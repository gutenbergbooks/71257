<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="One">I</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="ls">THE DRUM IN THE FOREST</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">M<span class="smcap">poko</span> the boy and Nkunda the girl were
squatting in the firelight just outside
their mother’s hut, where they could smell the
smells from the cooking pots the women were
tending so carefully. Their father, the chief
of the tiny village, had gone with his men two
days before on a trading journey to one of the
great markets. They should have been at home
before this.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_007.jpg"
 alt="winding brass wire">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Mpoko was busy winding a precious piece of
brass wire round the handle of his pet hunting
spear, and Nkunda was watching him. Each
man or boy of the village had his favorite spear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
with its leaf-shaped iron blade, and the wire on
the handle was useful as well as ornamental,
for it gave a good grip. Iron is found almost
everywhere in Africa, and the native blacksmiths
made not only spear heads but knife
blades and little axes. They could not make
brass, which is a mixture of copper and zinc, but
all traders had brass rods in their stores, and
these could be hammered into all sorts of shapes.
When these rods were first brought into the
country, they were made about thirty inches
long; but there was so much demand for smaller
pieces to use in trading like small change, that
they were now made only six or seven inches
in length. Nkunda had a piece of brass wire
almost as long as Mpoko’s, but hers was coiled
round her slender brown wrist as a bracelet.</p>

<p>In Central Africa, supper time is about six
o’clock all the year round. From one season to
another, night and day are nearly equal and
the time of sunrise and of sunset changes hardly
more than fifteen minutes throughout the year.
The year begins with the first heavy rain of the
wet season, and when the new green shoots come
out on the spurge thickets the people know that
the new year is at hand.</p>

<p>The evening meal is the most important one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
of the day, sometimes the only regular meal.
Soon after sunrise on this particular day the
women, as usual, had picked up their hoes, their
baskets, and their babies and had gone out to
work on the farms outside the village. They
had come back in the middle of the afternoon
to begin preparing supper, which was a matter
of some hours’ work, because there were so many
different things to be done. Grain for bread or
mush had to be ground on heavy stone slabs,
vegetables must be made ready for cooking,
water, fetched from the spring, wood brought,
and fires made. Mpoko and Nkunda had
helped a little, and they knew where, in a heap
of hot ashes, the sweet potatoes from their own
corner of the field were baking. There would
be boiled fowl and cassava bread, and maybe
some stewed fruit.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_009.jpg"
 alt="boy with goats">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Besides helping their mothers, the children
of the village had their own special work,—to
drive in the goats from the fields,—and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
had done this before sunset. All the shaggy,
bleating little animals were now safe in the pen
built of logs and roofed with planks, and Mpoko
had seen to it that stakes were set firmly across
the entrance to keep them in and keep out wild
beasts. Even as the children sat here in the
firelight they heard from time to time the hunting
call of a leopard or hyena, but no fierce
prowling creature of the jungle would come near
the fires.</p>

<p>The cooking fires were in the middle of the
open space around which the village was built.
The village itself was nothing more than a
rather irregular circle of huts inside a fence.
Mpoko and Nkunda were sitting at the very
edge of the great black shadow that closed in
the lighted space and, beyond the huts, melted
into the deep velvet darkness of the forest.
The forest was all around them, and it was full
of the noises of the night. The wind was
whispering in the great leaves and walking in
the tall grasses; the chitter and scamper of
some small animal or the call of sleepy birds
now and then broke the silence of the night.
Under the many rustlings and whisperings there
was always to be heard the voice of a mighty
river flowing through the wilderness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
The people of the village knew a great deal
about this river, but they could not have found
it on a map, for they had never seen such a
thing. White men call it the Congo. This
was the name of a chief who ruled the country
near the mouth of the river more than five hundred
years ago, before even the first Portuguese
explorers came. It was the Portuguese who
gave his name to the river. But the Congo has
many names in the twenty-five hundred miles
of its length. Here in the jungle it has a very
long name which means The-great-river-out-of-the-lake-that-drowns-the-locust-who-tries-to-fly-across.
If a person knows, as the Bantu people
do, how far a locust can fly without alighting,
this name for the great lake is really useful.
The whole of the name is Mwerukatamuvudanshi,
but nobody used it unless the chiefs were having
a formal council, and on the white men’s maps
the lake is called Mweru. In other parts of its
course the river was called after whatever lakes,
mountains, or cataracts there might be in the
neighborhood.</p>

<p>Mpoko and Nkunda talked a little about the
river as they squatted there in the warm darkness.
Mpoko had been promised that he should
go fishing when the canoes went downstream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
to mend a bridge that was shaky, and Nkunda
promised to help him make new nets for the
fishing. He finished winding the wire round
the spear handle and began to polish it with
great care.</p>

<p>Then very far away in the forest they heard
the tapping of a drum.</p>

<p>The sound of a drum in the African jungle
always means something. It may mean a
village dance; it may mean news; it may mean
sudden danger. It is not like any other noise
in the forest.</p>

<p>On the other side of the mountain, the great
towering mass of stone beyond the forest, was
the country of Tswki, the Snake, who was not
friendly to the river villages. When he was
getting ready to make war, whichever village
heard of it first, warned the others. Messengers
were not needed to take the warning, for the
sound of the drum could be heard over lake
and marsh, through tangles of wild jungle
where a man would have to cut his way at
every step. The drum was made of wood,
covered with oxhide stretched tight, or with
the skin of a large snake or lizard.</p>

<p>The children had been the first to hear the
tapping, because they were nearest to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
ground, but in a minute all the others, old and
young, heard it too, and listened. They stopped
whatever they were doing and stood as still as
trees, and listened, and listened.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_013.jpg"
 alt="boy hunting">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Then through the blackness of the forest, far
away, there sounded singing, and Mpoko and
Nkunda were not afraid any more. This was
not one of Tswki’s war parties that was coming;
it was their own men, singing all together to
forget their weariness on the last miles of the
trail. A Central African carrier will travel with
a load of sixty pounds from fifteen to thirty
miles a day. And this is not walking on a
level road; the carriers go through a wilderness
without anything like a road, the trail often
only a few inches wide. They may have to
climb steep hills, scramble over boulders, or
force their way through matted grasses ten and
twelve feet high. There are no pack animals.
Everything is carried on men’s backs, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
during most of the year the mercury is at about
eighty in the shade. When the men sing toward
the end of a journey, it is likely to be a sign
that they are very tired indeed. Often they
beat time with their sticks on their loads. But
now they surely had a drum, and somebody was
playing it.</p>

<p>At last Mpoko, listening very closely, caught
a line or two of the song, and he jumped up,
whirling his spear round his head and shouting,
“The Alo Man! The Alo Man!” Then
Nkunda, too, sprang up and began to dance
and whirl round and round, clapping her hands
and singing, “The Alo Man! The Alo Man is
coming!”</p>

<p>Every one was glad. The Alo Man, the
wandering story teller who went from place to
place telling stories and making songs, came
only once in a very long time. When he did
come, he told the most interesting and exciting
stories that any one in the village had ever
heard. He knew old stories and new ones,
and it was hard to say which were the finest.
No one could make the people see pictures in
their minds as he could. No one knew so many
wise sayings and amusing riddles. No one had
seen so many wonderful and interesting things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
among the people of so many different tribes.
Even when some one could remember and tell
over again the stories that the Alo Man had
told, they did not sound as they did when he
told them himself.</p>

<p>Even the dogs knew that something was going
to happen and began to bark excitedly, and the
slaty-blue, speckled guinea hens half woke and
ruffled their feathers and gave hoarse croaks
of surprise. The beat of the drum and the
singing voices grew louder and louder, until the
people waiting in the firelight caught the tune
and joined in the song, keeping time with the
clapping of their hands curved like cymbals.</p>

<p>Then there was a blaze of torches in the
forest, the dogs burst into a wild chorus of
yelping and baying, and out of the dark they
came, the whole company of them. Every
man was keeping step to the splendid new song
that the Alo Man led. Each one marched into
the open circle of firelight, flung down his pack,
and began to tell the news to his own family
and ask for something to eat as soon as it could
possibly be had.</p>

<p>They were all glad—the whole village—to
see the Alo Man, and he was just as glad to see
them. His white teeth flashed and his eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
shone as he greeted one old friend after another,
and asked and answered questions as fast as
his tongue would go. Cooking pots were hustled
off the fire and good things ladled out, and soon
the feasting and laughter and story-telling and
singing of the Alo Man’s visit had fairly begun.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Two">II</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="ls">THE STRING OF BEADS</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">here</span> was great chattering in the village
over the unloading of the packs with the
various wares brought from the market. The
marketing arrangements of wild Africa are very
curious. There are four days in a Congo week,—Konzo,
Nkenge, Nsona, and Nkandu,—and
on at least one of the four days a market is held
somewhere near every important village. All
markets held on Konzo are called Konzo markets,
those held on Nkenge are called Nkenge markets,
and so on. Each of the four kinds of markets
is in a different place, but there is one of the
four within five miles of every town. In the
village where Mpoko and Nkunda lived, the
people had to go four miles to the Konzo market,
nine to the Nkenge market, sixteen to the
Nsona and twenty to the Nkandu, but this
last market was quite near the next village
downstream.</p>

<p>Some of these markets were noted for certain
goods. Mpoko’s mother could always depend
on pigs being on sale at the Nkenge market,
and whoever had a pig to sell would be likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
to take it there. At the Konzo market, four
miles away, were good pots, calabashes, and
saucepans, some of which were made by women
in their village, for one of the old grandmothers
was rather famous for her pottery. Other
markets were known for palm wine, iron work,
oil, or some other specialty, and besides these
things cassava roots, peanuts, kwanga (native
bread), palm oil, beans and other vegetables,
grains and fowls were generally sold in all
markets.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_018.jpg"
 alt="market">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Besides these markets, larger markets were
held occasionally, from one to another of which
the traders traveled with things not made in
the country. Besides the brass rods, blue
beads were sometimes used as a kind of money,
a farthing string of a hundred beads being
passed from hand to hand; or it might be used
to buy food in small quantities, ten or fifteen
blue beads three eighths of an inch long and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
about a quarter of an inch thick being used as
small change.</p>

<p>A great deal of produce was simply swapped
from one person to another. A man might
gather a quantity of some produce like tobacco,
rubber, raffia, palm oil, or grain, at one market
and another, and take it finally to the great
market to exchange for beads, brass, calico, or
whatever else he found there. Salt is so rare
in some parts of Africa that it is used for money,
and a man will work as a porter so many days
for so many bags of salt. When the people
make salt on the shores of an inland lake, they
have to gather the salty sand and wash it out
in pots specially made, with little holes in the
bottom into which the salt water runs; then the
water is dried away over slow fires and the salt
scraped off the sides of the kettle. It takes less
time and labor to earn salt ready made than to
make it in this way. Salt is also made from
grass ashes.</p>

<p>The packs of the village men had in them not
only salt, but many pieces of gay-colored cloth,
beads, and wire. Nkunda felt that hers was
the best share of all, when her mother called
her to have hung round her neck a string of
bright red coral beads. No other little girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
had a string half so pretty, Nkunda thought.
The more she fingered the little, smooth,
scarlet drops of her necklace, the more she
admired them.</p>

<p>Seeing her delight, the Alo Man grinned and
showed all his white teeth.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they will bring you luck,” he said,
“as the youngest sister’s beads did in the
story.”</p>

<p>Of course, after that, every one wanted to
hear the story.</p>

<p>The Alo Man settled himself cross-legged on
a mat, all the listeners squatted down within
easy hearing distance, and he began the story
of the String of Beads.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I often am reminded [he said] of the three
sisters who lived in a land many days’ journey
from here. Each of them had a string of beads,
but the youngest sister, her beads were of red
coral, and the others, their beads were only
common cowrie shells. Naturally, they hated
her, and one day when they had all been bathing
in the river, the older sisters hid their beads in
the sand.</p>

<p>“See,” said the eldest sister as the youngest
sister came out of the water, “we have thrown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
our beads into the river, where there is a strong
water-goblin who will give us back twice as
many. Throw your own beads into the river
and then you will have two strings of coral
beads, and two is always better than one.”</p>

<p>“Except when you have a lame foot,” said
the other sister, giggling.</p>

<p>The youngest sister believed what they said,
and threw her beads into the river, and they
went down, down, down to the bottom of the
deepest pool and did not come up again.</p>

<p>Then the two elder sisters laughed and took
their own beads and hung them round their
necks, and filled their water jars and went
home.</p>

<p>“How foolish I was,” said the youngest sister,
sadly. “I wonder if the river would not give
them back to me if I should ask very
politely?”</p>

<p>She began to walk along the bank, saying,
“Water, water, please give me back my beads,
my pretty beads!” And the water answered,
“Go down the stream! Go down the stream!”</p>

<p>[The Alo Man made his voice sound exactly
like the gurgle and splash of the ripples.]</p>

<p>She went on a little way and asked the river
again to give back her beads. And again the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
river answered, “Go down the stream! Go
down the stream!”</p>

<p>The youngest sister went along the river
bank until she could no longer see the village.
She had never been so far away from it before.
At last she came to a place where the river
leaped over a great cliff. Under the waterfall
was a hut with an old woman sitting at the door.
She was bent and wrinkled and very, very ugly,
and she looked up as the youngest sister looked
down at her from the bank.</p>

<p>“Do not laugh at me!” said the old woman.
“I am ugly now, but once I was beautiful as
you are.”</p>

<p>“I am not laughing at you, good mother,”
said the youngest sister. “I should like to do
something to help you.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, my child,” said the old
woman. “Will you be so good as to bind up
my wounds and give me water to drink?”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
 <img src="images/i_023.jpg"
 alt="landscape with cabin">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The youngest sister took a strip of her garment
and bound up the old woman’s wounds
and fed and comforted her as if she had been
the old woman’s own daughter. Scarcely had
she done this when the old woman caught her
by the arm. “My child,” she said, “you have
come to a place where a terrible giant lives.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
Every one who comes down the river is in danger
of falling into his hands. But do not be afraid;
he shall not hurt you. Hark! there he comes
now, like a great wind that brings the rain.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, the wind began to blow, and
the rain poured, and the lightning flashed, and
it grew very cold. The old woman hid the
youngest sister behind a wall.</p>

<p>Then the giant came to the bank of the
river.</p>

<p>“Some one has come to the hut,” said he, in
a great roaring voice. “I am hungry. Bring
her out and let me have her for my supper.”</p>

<p>“But you must have your sleep first,” said
the old woman.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the giant, “it is true; I am very
weary.”</p>

<p>Then the giant lay down and went to sleep.</p>

<p>When he was sound asleep the old woman
led the youngest sister out from behind the
wall, and hung round her neck a string of beads
more beautiful than any she had ever seen, and
put rings of gold on her arms and on her ankles.
Around her waist she hung a kirtle of the softest
and finest kidskin, with copper fringe, and
over her shoulders she threw a silver jackal
skin. In her hand she placed a magic stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
“When you reach the river bank,” said the
old woman, “press the stone to your lips. Then
throw it over your shoulder, and it will return
to me.”</p>

<p>The youngest sister did as the old woman
told her, and very soon she reached the place
where she lived with her two sisters. They
looked with the greatest surprise at her beautiful
dress and ornaments and asked where she had
found them. When she told them an old
woman had given them to her, they said, without
waiting to hear the story, “We too will go to
the old woman,” and throwing their beads into
the river they ran along the banks, calling to
the waters to return them.</p>

<p>After so long a time they came to the hut
where the old woman sat. The giant was no
longer there, and the old woman was sitting
crouched in the doorway as before.</p>

<p>“Do not laugh at me,” said the old woman.
“I am ugly now, but once I was young and
beautiful as you are.”</p>

<p>The two sisters laughed at this, and ridiculed
the old woman, and called her all the jeering
names they could think of.</p>

<p>“Will you not bind up my wounds and give
me water to drink?” asked the old woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
But the sisters said that they had never
heard of such impudence.</p>

<p>“Where are the bracelets and beads you have
to give away?” asked the elder sister.</p>

<p>“Where are your mantles and kirtles with
fringe?” asked the younger. “We come for
these, not to waste our time on you. We must
make haste and go home.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I think you must,” said the old
woman, “for this place is the home of a giant
who comes in the form of wind and rain, and I
hear him coming now!”</p>

<p>Then the hut sank under the waters, and the
maidens found themselves standing on the
bank without even their own beads to deck
themselves with. That very moment they
heard the wind and the rain sweeping through
the trees, and they turned and ran as fast as
their feet would carry them, back to their own
village, while the wind and the rain howled
behind them and the giant pelted them with
stones.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_026.jpg"
 alt="running in rainstorm">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
All the people laughed and shouted over the
ill fortune of the two selfish sisters. Nkunda,
where she lay curled up at her mother’s side,
fingered her beads and wondered if the youngest
sister’s beads from beneath the waterfall could
have been any prettier than these. In the part
where the giant came in, the story sent delightful
shivers down all their backs, for they could
every one remember storms in which the great
wind had shaken the trees like an invisible
giant and the rain had come pelting down like
stones. Sometimes, after a storm, the path
of the wind through the forest looked like the
track of a huge giant who had gone walking up
and down, twisting off boughs and rooting up
trees merely to show what he could do. During
one of these storms the temperature often falls
from thirty to forty degrees in half an hour.</p>

<p>Nkunda had seen a silvery jackal skin and a
copper-fringed robe among her mother’s treasures,
but one thing in the story puzzled her.
“Mother,” she said softly, “what is gold?”</p>

<p>The Alo Man heard her and smiled. “Have
you never seen gold?” he asked.</p>

<p>The children shook their heads. Gold was
not found in that part of the country.</p>

<p>Then the Alo Man explained that in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
streams of other parts of the country the people
found lumps of a shining yellow metal softer
and more beautiful than iron, for which the
traders would pay much cloth and many brass
rods. When the headman heard what they
were talking about, he showed the children a
little bright round bangle on his arm, and told
them that that was gold. It was really, though
no one there knew it, a half-sovereign lost by
some trader, or perhaps given in mistake for a
sixpence, which is exactly the same size. The
headman had kept it, first because of its beauty,
and then because a trader had told him that it
was worth as much as ten pounds of rubber, or
more than a hundred pounds of palm kernels,
or a load of palm oil, or about thirty-five pounds
of coffee. Nkunda thought that the little piece
of gold was rather like a magic stone.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Three">III</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="ls">THE LEOPARD AND THE DOG</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">O<span class="smcap">n</span> the third night of the Alo Man’s stay in
the village there was a great disturbance
out near the goat pen. The frightened bleating
of the goats was almost drowned by the barking
and growling of dogs, and the angry snarl of
some fierce animal.</p>

<p>Some of the hunters caught up their spears
and ran to see what the matter was, and Mpoko,
catching up his own little spear, raced after
them, for he could hear the furious barking of
his own dog in the pack. Even the baby
brother, who could only just stand on his feet,
lifted his head and listened, saying, “Mfwa!
Mfwa!” Mpoko’s dog was one of the family;
he had played with the children ever since he
was a little yellow-brown flop-eared puppy.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_029.jpg"
 alt="hunters with trophy">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
But the trouble was soon over. Before any
one had had time to ask many questions, the
hunters came back in triumph with the body of
a big, fierce leopard. He had leaped upon the
roof of the goat pen and tried to break in, but
the dogs had found it out at once. They had
set up such a baying and yelping that the robber
was frightened, and he was trying to get away
when the hunters arrived with their spears.
They tied his paws together and slung him over
a pole carried on their shoulders, and tomorrow
he would be taken about to all the villages and
exhibited. And the chief would have the skin.</p>

<p>Mpoko was very proud to be able to tell his
sister that he had seen the leopard killed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>

that his dog had been in the very thick of the
fight. Moreover, he was sure that when he
flung his own spear at the leopard it had gone
through the skin somewhere, even if he could
not point out the exact place.</p>

<p>“Mfwa! Mfwa!” said the baby, with his fat
fists waving at the dog, and all the dogs strutted
about, very proud of their night’s work.</p>

<p>“I wonder why dogs hate a leopard so,” said
Nkunda, as the excitement quieted down.</p>

<p>“My dog belongs to me, and he knows the
leopard is my enemy,” said Mpoko.</p>

<p>“Cats and dogs hate each other too, and the
cat is not my enemy,” said Nkunda, trying to
coax her pet cat down from the branch of a
tree where she crouched, hissing at the dogs.</p>

<p>“Cats and dogs always hate each other,”
said Mpoko, and he seemed to think that that
was reason enough.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_30-31.jpeg"
 alt="cat treed by two dogs">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>“There is a good reason why the dog and the
leopard do not like each other,” said the Alo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>

Man. Then he told the story of the Leopard
and the Dog.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I often tell of the time when all the animals
lived in a country by themselves, and the
mother of leopards had two fine young cubs in
her cave in the forest. As they grew older,
she knew she must go out to find food for them,
and she was afraid that if she left them alone,
they would be stolen from her.</p>

<p>She began to look about among the animals
to find some one to take care of her cubs while
she went hunting.</p>

<p>“What will you give me to come and take care
of your cubs?” asked the Hyena.</p>

<p>“I will give you a good home in my cave and
plenty of food,” said the Leopard.</p>

<p>“He-yah! he-yah! he-yah!” laughed the
Hyena, in a loud, harsh voice that almost
frightened the Leopard herself.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_032.jpg"
 alt="leopards">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
“Your voice is too loud,” she said. “You
would make such a noise that my cubs would
be frightened to death.”</p>

<p>The Hyena laughed again louder than before
and went away to tell how he had scared the
Leopard with his laughing.</p>

<p>“What will you give me to take care of your
cubs?” called the Owl up in the tree top.</p>

<p>“I will give you a good home in my cave and
plenty of food,” said the Leopard.</p>

<p>“Hoo! hoo! hoo-oo!” hooted the Owl, glaring
down at the Leopard with great round eyes
that almost frightened the Leopard herself.</p>

<p>“Your eyes are too large and bright,” said
the Leopard. “My cubs would be frightened
out of their wits when you stared at them.”</p>

<p>The Owl hooted even louder than before and
flew away to tell all the animals how he had
frightened the Leopard by staring at her.</p>

<p>“What will you give me to take care of your
cubs?” asked the Snake from the tall grass.</p>

<p>“I will give you a good home in my cave and
plenty of food,” said the Leopard.</p>

<p>“Tsz! tsz! tsz!” hissed the Snake, so loudly
that the Leopard jumped and was almost
frightened at the noise.</p>

<p>“I do not want you to take care of my cubs,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
said the Leopard. “If they heard you hiss like
that, they would be frightened to death.”</p>

<p>The Snake hissed again louder than before,
and slid away through the tall grass to tell all
the other animals how he had startled the
Leopard by hissing at her.</p>

<p>“What will you give me to take care of your
cubs?” asked the Dog.</p>

<p>“I will give you a good home in my cave and
plenty of food,” said the Leopard.</p>

<p>“Mfwa! Mfwa!” barked the Dog, wagging
his tail as hard as he could, and grinning so that
every one of his white teeth showed. The
Leopard looked at him and was pleased.</p>

<p>[Here the Alo Man, who had imitated the
voice of each animal in the story, barked so well
that all the dogs barked and whined, and came
to rub their heads against his legs. Everybody
laughed, and it really seemed as if the dogs
understood the story as well as any one.]</p>

<p>The Leopard went to her cave, with the Dog
trotting after her and sniffing at her tracks.
She gave him a good supper of rabbit bones, and
when she told him how to take care of the cubs
he listened very carefully.</p>

<p>The next day the Leopard went out to hunt,
and the Dog stayed in the cave and did exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
as he had been told. After a while the Leopard
came back, dragging a fine Antelope.</p>

<p>“This is for my supper and the cubs’ supper,”
she said, “and tomorrow you shall have the
bones for your dinner.”</p>

<p>The Dog thought of the good dinner he would
have off those large bones, and he wagged his
tail and grinned.</p>

<p>“But remember this,” went on the Leopard,
“you must never take bones outside the cave.
We never eat outside our caves, but always
inside. If people change their customs, there
is no telling what will happen.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_035.jpg"
 alt="dog in cave">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Next day the Leopard went to hunt, and the
Dog lay down across the doorway of the cave
and watched over the cubs. At dinner time
he began to gnaw at the bones of the Antelope,
as he had been told, inside the cave. But it was
inconvenient. The rock floor was uneven, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
he could not get his teeth into the bones properly.
When he cracked the bone to get at the marrow
he got some earth into it, and he did not like
that at all.</p>

<p>“I may as well take the bones out on the
clean grass and finish my dinner,” said the Dog
to himself. “Nobody will ever know.”</p>

<p>But when he had taken the bones out of the
cave upon the grass, the strangest things began
to happen. The bones began to move about
as if they were coming to life. Before the Dog
could catch them and drag them back into the
cave, one of the great leg-bones of the Antelope
hit a Leopard cub on the head and killed it
dead.</p>

<p>This was a dreadful thing indeed. The Dog
had never dreamed of hurting the cub. He
dragged all the bones back into the cave as
quickly as he could, for fear the other cub might
be killed. He could not think what he should
do in this terrible situation, and while he stood
trembling and whimpering with fear and grief,
he heard the Leopard coming.</p>

<p>“I will try to hide the dead cub until the
Leopard has gone to sleep,” he said to himself,
“and then I will run away.”</p>

<p>The Leopard came up to the cave, dragging a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
fine fat wild pig. First of all she asked, “Are
the cubs well and happy?”</p>

<p>The Dog was very much frightened, but he
went into the cave and fetched out the live
cub. “See how well he looks,” he said.</p>

<p>The Leopard looked the cub all over and
licked it with her strong tongue. Then she
said, “This one seems very well. Now show
me the other.”</p>

<p>The Dog took the live cub back into the cave
and brought it out again. The two cubs looked
so much alike that he had never been able to
tell them apart, and he thought that perhaps
the Leopard would be deceived.</p>

<p>But the Leopard gave one look at the cub
and then sprang at the Dog.</p>

<p>“You stupid creature,” she snarled, “do you
think you can fool me in that way?”</p>

<p>The Dog made one dash away from the cave
entrance and down the path through the forest,
with the Leopard at his heels. He ran out of
the forest and across the plain, up hills and down
valleys, with the Leopard at his heels. He ran
until he was almost dead, and when he had
hardly strength to go another step he saw a
hollow tree with a hole in it big enough for him
to get into, but too small for the Leopard to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
follow him. Into it he went, his tail curled
between his legs and all four feet gathered under
him. Hard as she tried, the Leopard could
not quite reach him with her paw.</p>

<p>In the tree sat a Monkey, watching the
goings-on and chattering with excitement. The
Leopard looked up and saw him.</p>

<p>“Come down out of that tree and watch this
hole for me,” said the Leopard. “I am going
to gather sticks and kindle a fire to burn up this
good-for-nothing Dog.”</p>

<p>The Monkey dared not refuse, and he came
down and sat in front of the hole.</p>

<p>When the Leopard had gone away, the Dog
peeped out very cautiously.</p>

<p>“I know where there is a tree full of ripe
nuts,” he said to the Monkey. “If you will
let me get away, I will show you where
it is.”</p>

<p>“But I am afraid of the Leopard,” chattered
the Monkey.</p>

<p>“The Leopard will never know,” said the
Dog. “When the tree burns, she will think
that I am burning inside of it.”</p>

<p>Finally the Monkey let the Dog out, and he
crept into the grass and hid, for he saw the
Leopard coming back with a load of sticks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
“Have you kept close watch of the hole?”
asked the Leopard.</p>

<p>“I have not gone away for a minute,” said
the Monkey. “I have kept my eyes on the hole
ever since you went away.”</p>

<p>Then the Leopard made a fire and the tree
began to blaze up.</p>

<p>“Hear the Dog’s bones crackle!” chattered
the Monkey as the branches began to snap in
the flames.</p>

<p>The Dog thought that this might be a good
time for him to escape through the grass,
but the Leopard saw the grass wave where he
was hiding, and she made a quick jump for the
place. Away ran the Dog once more for dear
life, with the Leopard coming after him in great
leaps.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_039.jpg"
 alt="leopard">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>It would have been a sad day for the Dog if
there had not been coming that way a party<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
of Men. He rushed up to them and crouched
at the feet of the Chief and looked up into his
face for protection.</p>

<p>When the Chief saw the Leopard, who had
often carried off goats and cattle from his village,
and looked down at the panting, terrified
Dog, he was sorry for the Dog and, bending
over, patted him on the head.</p>

<p>“Do not be afraid,” he said. “The Leopard
shall not hurt you.”</p>

<p>The Leopard looked at the sharp spears of
the Chief and his followers, and went growling
away to her cave in the forest. Ever since
that time the Dog loves man better than he
does any of the animals of the forest, and serves
him against all his enemies; and if the Leopard
comes to steal from the village, the Dog will
call for the man to drive him away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
“Mfwa! Mfwa!” said Mpoko’s dog, looking
up into his master’s face and then grinning at
the leopard. And Mpoko and Nkunda were
certain that he had understood every word of
the story that the Alo Man had told.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Four">IV</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="ls">THE CAT AND THE RAT</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">O<span class="smcap">n</span> the fourth night of the Alo Man’s stay,
Nkunda was looking for her cat. She had
been feeling a little jealous that day, because
Mpoko and every one else gave so much attention
to the dogs. It seemed as if the cat too
might be jealous, or perhaps the dogs were so
proud of themselves that they wanted the village
to themselves, for Nkunda had not seen her pet
since the night before.</p>

<p>Even the baby, rolling about in the doorway,
had missed his playmate, and he repeated
Nkunda’s call, which sounded very like cat
language. In the Ki-sukama dialect of the
Bantu language the cat is called Ca-ungu, in
the Ki-fipa dialect, Inyao, and in Isi-nyixa
talk it is Unyawu; but all these names sound
like the little “miaou” that the cat makes when
she has something to show you, and this was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
the sound that came out of the darkness in
answer to Nkunda’s call.</p>

<p>The sound came from the direction of the
granary. This was a building planned very
carefully for its special purpose. It was a
large round basket-work structure, plastered
with mud and built on a floor raised above the
ground on short legs of forked branches. This
floor or platform was made in such a way as to
keep out rats. Nevertheless, now and then one
would make an entrance, and as Nkunda came
up to the platform the cat leaped down, carrying
in her mouth a large rat. It was as if she wished
to prove that she could take care of herself,
whether any one else remembered her or not.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_42-43.jpg"
 alt="cat stalking rat">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Nkunda called her mother and showed her
what the cat had brought, and a little crowd
gathered about the granary. Purring proudly,
the cat led the way to a hole where the wall
had crumbled from dampness or had been
gnawed away, and it was quite large enough for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
a rat to get in. If the cat had not been so
prompt in disposing of the thief, he and his
family might have gone to housekeeping in
there; but as it was, little harm had been done.</p>

<p>“The hole must be stopped up,” said Nkunda’s
mother. “The rain might get in and all the
grain would mold, through a hole like that.”</p>

<p>“And we must have a rat hunt,” said Mpoko,
coming up with his special friend Nkula to look
at the hole. “But we must make some new
traps and get our bows and arrows in order
first. There will be no rats about when we
have finished with them!”</p>

<p>“That is all very well,” said Nkunda, stroking
her cat; “but your trap did not catch this
rat and my cat did.”</p>

<p>The rat hunt took place, however. All the
boys in the village came to it, and it was a
most exciting time. The farm rat of Equatorial
Africa is a rather pretty little brown animal
with black stripes, and the boys do their hunting
with traps and their small bows and arrows.
The traps are made of basket-work and are cone-shaped.
They are set in a group in the middle
of a large grassy space where there is reason to
suppose the rats are, and then the boys take
their stand in a circle round the edge of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
ground and begin to walk toward the center,
kicking up the grass as they go, and shouting.
The rats scamper toward the center, where
they are likely to run into the traps; but they
have a habit of starting to run and then stopping
for a moment to look about, and this gives the
boys a chance to shoot them down with their
small, sharp arrows. Between the traps and
the shooting a considerable number of rats
rewarded the hunters, and meanwhile the hole
in the granary was well patched up with wattle
and mud.</p>

<p>Rats find a great deal that they like in an
African village, and there are usually plenty of
them to be hunted by both cats and boys. The
people do not raise wheat, but they have other
things that they eat as we eat bread. Millet,
barley, and maize or “mealies” are cultivated
on the farms and ground on stone slabs. The
meal is made into mush or into flat cakes baked
before the fire like hoecake.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_045.jpg"
 alt="cat with rat in its mouth">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
The commonest substitute for bread is manioc
or cassava, which was brought from South
America about four hundred years ago by
Portuguese explorers. The jungle people call
it madioka. The making of manioc flour is
quite a long and troublesome piece of work.
Nine months after planting, the bulblike roots
are pulled up and are soaked for a few days in
pools or streams. The fresh root is poisonous,
and the soaking takes out the poison. After
this, the roots are peeled, cut in pieces, and dried
in the sun on small platforms or on stones.
When they are quite dry, they are laid on shelves
over the fire until they are brittle enough to be
pounded and sifted and made into flour.</p>

<p>Another way of using manioc is to make
kwanga, or native bread. For this, the root
is soaked as for making flour, but instead of
then being dried, it is kneaded to remove all
lumps until it is a kind of dough that can be
shaped into rolls or round balls. After being
moulded into shape, the rolls are wrapped in
large, smooth leaves and steamed until they are
cooked.</p>

<p>The taste of manioc prepared in this way is
like that of tapioca. In fact, the starch washed
out of cassava roots, and dried and packed, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
the tapioca found in grocery stores. The fresh
tapioca that is eaten in a cassava country is,
however, very much better than what is sold in
stores.</p>

<p>Kwanga is sold in markets at the rate of a
shilling for fifty pounds, and four pounds will
last a man a day. When the men of the village
went on a trading journey, or into the forest to
gather palm nuts or to cut wood, they always
took with them a supply of kwanga. The
women had been busy making some that very
day, for there was to be an expedition down
the river which would start the following morning.
This was why the rat, in his corner of the
granary, had been left to nibble and to gnaw
undisturbed.</p>

<p>While the cat enjoyed her well-earned supper,
Nkunda sidled up to the Alo Man. She had
been thinking that perhaps it was as important
to keep the rats out of the grain as to keep the
leopards away from the goat pen.</p>

<p>“Is there a story about the cat?” she asked.
“She knew that the rat was stealing our grain
when no one else did.”</p>

<p>“There is certainly a story about her,” said
the Alo Alan. Then he told the story which
explains why the Cat and the Rat are enemies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
I often think [said the Alo Man] of the time,
very long ago, when the Cat and the Rat were
friends and lived together on an island. It was
so long ago that they have both forgotten it,
but they led a very happy life. There were
birds in the trees for the Cat to eat, and there
were nuts and manioc roots for the Rat to eat.</p>

<p>But nobody was ever so happy as not to want
something more. One day the Rat said, “I
am tired of living on this island. Let us go and
find a village to live in. There you can have
food without catching birds, and I can have
food without digging in the ground.”</p>

<p>“That will be delightful,” said the Cat.
“But how are we to cross this great water?”</p>

<p>“Nothing is more easy,” said the Rat. “We
will carve a boat from the root of a manioc.”</p>

<p>Then the Cat and the Rat dug up a large
manioc root and began making it into a boat.</p>

<p>The Rat gnawed and gnawed and gnawed
with his sharp teeth, until he had made a hollow
large enough to hold the two friends. While
he was busy at this, the Cat scratched and
scratched and scratched, to make the outside of
the boat smooth and to scrape off all the earth
that clung to the great root.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>[“Look! look!” cried Nkunda, laughing, for
her cat was standing on two legs, scratching at
a tree, just as if she wanted to show what cat-claws
can do.]</p>

<p>Then the Cat and the Rat [went on the Alo
Man] made two little paddles and started out
in their boat.</p>

<p>It was much farther across the great water
than it had looked from their island. Also
they had forgotten to put any food into the
boat. Presently the Cat began to say “Caungu!
Caungu!” which means “I am hungry! I am
hungry!”</p>

<p>And the Rat said “Quee! Quee!” which means
in his language “I am hungry! I am hungry!”</p>

<p>But that did not do any good. They grew
hungrier and hungrier. At last the Cat said
“Caungu! Caungu!” very faintly, and curled
herself up to sleep. And the Rat said “Quee!
Quee!” very faintly, and curled himself up also,
at the other end of the boat.</p>

<p>[When the Alo Man made the Cat and Rat
noises, the listeners made them too, and there
was a great deal of laughing. Nkunda’s own
cat was cuddled up in the little girl’s arms, her
yellow eyes shining like two little moons, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
she seemed to know that this was her very own
story.]</p>

<p>But while the Cat slept, the Rat stayed awake
and thought. Suddenly he remembered that
the boat itself was made of manioc. He had
eaten so much while he was gnawing out the
hollow that he had not wanted any more for
some time, but now he said, “Good! I will eat
a little more and make the hollow deeper.”</p>

<p>So he began—nibble, nibble, nibble!</p>

<p>“What is that noise?” exclaimed the Cat,
waking at the sound.</p>

<p>But the Rat had shut his eyes and made himself
as if he were fast asleep.</p>

<p>“I must have been dreaming,” said the Cat,
and she laid her head down on her paws and
went to sleep again.</p>

<p>The Rat began again—nibble, nibble, nibble!</p>

<p>“What is that noise?” cried the Cat, waking
up.</p>

<p>But the Rat made himself seem to be fast
asleep.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_050.jpg"
 alt="cat sleeping in row boat">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
“What strange dreams I have,” said the Cat,
as she curled herself up and went to sleep again.</p>

<p>Once more the Rat began to nibble very fast,
and the noise awoke the Cat.</p>

<p>“What is that noise?” asked the Cat.</p>

<p>But the Rat made believe to be sound asleep.</p>

<p>“My dreams are certainly very troublesome,”
said the Cat, as she curled herself up and went
to sleep once more with her paw folded over her
eyes.</p>

<p>Then the Rat began nibbling again, and this
time he gnawed a hole right through the bottom
of the boat, and the water began to come in.</p>

<p>“What is this?” cried the Cat, jumping up
quickly.</p>

<p>“Quee, quee, quee!” squealed the Rat, perching
on one end of the boat.</p>

<p>“Caungu! Caungu!” miaued the Cat, climbing
up on the other end, for she did not like the
water at all.</p>

<p>“Quee, quee!”</p>

<p>“Caungu! Ca-ungu-u-u!”</p>

<p>“Quee, quee!”</p>

<p>“You did this, you wicked creature!” squalled
the Cat.</p>

<p>“I was so hungry!” squeaked the Rat, and
then the boat began to sink, and there was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
time for any more talk. They had to swim for
their lives.</p>

<p>“I am going to eat you,” said the Cat, glaring
at the Rat as they swam.</p>

<p>“I deserve it,” squeaked the Rat; “but don’t
eat me now or you will be choked by the water.
Wait until we reach the shore.”</p>

<p>“I will wait,” said the Cat, “but when we
reach the shore I will certainly eat you.”</p>

<p>At last they reached the dry land.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the Cat, “I will eat you.”</p>

<p>“I deserve it,” said the Rat, “but I am too
wet to be good eating now. Let me dry myself,
while you dry your own beautiful coat. I shall
be ready when you are.”</p>

<p>They sat down and began to dry their coats.
[Nkunda’s cat was licking her breast and her
coal-black paws and the fur of her striped and
mottled gray back with all the care in the world.]
And the Cat [went on the Alo Man] was so
interested in making her beautiful coat quite
smooth and glossy that she did not see that the
Rat was busily digging a hole in the earth behind
her.</p>

<p>“Are you ready?” asked the Cat at last,
when every part of her coat was dry and glossy
and smooth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
“Certainly,” said the Rat, and he disappeared
into the hole.</p>

<p>“You rascal!” cried the Cat, for the hole was
only just big enough for the Rat to dive into it.</p>

<p>“Quee, quee!” said the Rat from the bottom
of the hole.</p>

<p>“You will never get out of that hole alive,”
said the Cat. “I will stay here and wait for
you, and when you come out I will eat you.”</p>

<p>“What if I never come out?” said the Rat.
“Quee, quee!”</p>

<p>“Then you can stay in that hole and starve,”
said the Cat, and she settled down in front of
the hole with her nose on her paws and all four
feet under her, watching for the Rat to come
out.</p>

<p>“Quee, quee!” said the Rat, in the hole, and
he began to dig himself in deeper.</p>

<p>All day long the Rat went on digging.</p>

<p>All day long the Cat watched beside the hole.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_053.jpg"
 alt="cat waiting at rat hole">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>When night came, the Rat had dug down
under a tree root and had come up on the other
side of the tree, and he crept out of the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
end of his tunnel and went on to the village,
while the Cat still watched at her end.</p>

<p>From that day to this the Cat is never so
fast asleep that she does not hear the gnawing
of a Rat, and she is never tired of watching for
the Rat to come out of a hole. And from that
day to this the Rat knows that if there is a Cat
in the village where he goes to steal grain, he
will find the Cat waiting for him at one end or
the other of his hole in the ground.</p>

<h4 class="ls">THE JACKAL AND HIS TRACKS</h4>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_055.jpg"
 alt="rhino">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">here</span> seemed to be no animal in the forest
or the swamp or on the plain about which
the Alo Man did not know a story. In the nine
hundred thousand miles of country, more or
less, through which the Congo and its branches
flow, there is land suitable for almost every
kind of wild creature known to Africa. Elephants,
buffalo, wild cattle, rhinoceros, antelope,
koodoo, eland, giraffes, pigs, and other grazing
and browsing animals wander over the grassy
table-lands. Hippopotami, crocodiles, and other
water creatures live in the rivers and swamps,
and among the beasts of prey are lions, leopards,
hyenas, and jackals, although the jackal is not
much to be feared. Monkeys large and small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
are numerous in the forests, and in a part of the
forest so old and deep that the people call it the
Plantations of God, the gorilla is sometimes
found. In the Alo Man’s stories, however,
the smaller animals almost always had the best
of it. They also had much more to say for
themselves at night. As the old people put it,
it is not always the biggest man whose words
come in crowds.</p>

<p>“Do you know the reason why the hyena’s
legs are not alike?” asked the Alo Man one
night after supper, when there was a great
to-do out in the darkness.</p>

<p>No one did, and of course every one wanted
to hear the story of the Hyena and the Jackal.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I often recall [began the Alo Man] the days
when the animals could talk and the Hyena
and the Jackal lived in the same village. One
day they were looking up at the clouds.</p>

<p>“They are very thick and white,” said the
Jackal. “Can it be possible that they are solid
white fat?”</p>

<p>The Jackal waited until one cloud floated
quite near the earth, and then he climbed a
tree and sprang into the very middle of that
cloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_057.jpg"
 alt="jackal and hyena">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
[That the Jackal should climb a tree did not
seem strange to any of the listeners when the
Alo Man told the story; all of them had seen a
man climb a palm tree for nuts by looping two
ropes around the trunk and putting his feet in
one and the other by turns, walking up the
trunk to the very top.]</p>

<p>“I was right,” said the Jackal; “it is the most
delicious white fat.”</p>

<p>Then he ate and ate, until he was so full that
he was afraid to try to climb down the tree.</p>

<p>“I am coming down!” cried the Jackal to the
Hyena. “Catch me as I fall, or I shall be
hurt.”</p>

<p>The Hyena planted her feet firmly in the earth
and arched her back, and when the Jackal
jumped he landed on her back unhurt.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said he, but he was not really
grateful at all. He was already planning to
play a joke on the Hyena.</p>

<p>“Climb up on the cloud and eat some of the
good white fat,” said he. “It is the finest
food I have ever eaten in my life.”</p>

<p>The Hyena was glad to hear that the Jackal
had left some for her, and she climbed the tree
and jumped out upon the cloud and began to
eat. She ate and ate, as the Jackal had done,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
until she was so full that she did not dare to
try to climb down the tree.</p>

<p>“I am coming down! Catch me!” she called
to the Jackal, and he planted his four feet firmly
in the ground and stood under the cloud. But
as she jumped he stepped back, and down came
the Hyena on her hind legs. So far and so hard
did she fall that her hind legs were driven into
her body, and have ever since been shorter than
her fore legs, as you may see to this day.</p>

<p>But the Jackal’s turn came in time, for no
dog is top dog in every fight. This is what
happened to him.</p>

<p>One day the sun came down into the forest
and sat down on the soft green earth, to rest.
The Jackal came by and saw the sun resting
there, and his eyes were dazzled so that he
thought it was a goat. Now a goat would make
him a fine dinner, so he pounced upon it quickly
and put it in a sack and threw the sack over his
shoulders to carry home.</p>

<p>He had not traveled far when the sun began
to burn his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! oh!” cried the Jackal, trying to
throw the sun off his shoulders. “Get down!
get down!”</p>

<p>But the sun would not get down until he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
quite ready, and the Jackal’s back was scorched
in a long black stripe which he wears to this
day.</p>

<p>When the Hyena saw the long black stripe
she howled with delight, and ever since then,
when the Hyena and the Jackal meet and the
Hyena sees the stripe on the Jackal’s back, the
Hyena laughs and the Jackal yelps, just as you
hear them doing now [concluded the Alo Man].</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Hyena and the Jackal were certainly
making an uncommon racket even for them,
and then, quite suddenly, they stopped.</p>

<p>“The Jackal must have been at his old tricks
again,” said the Alo Man. “It sounds as if he
still remembered what he did in the time of the
great drought.”</p>

<p>“Tell about it,” begged the girls.</p>

<p>“Yes, tell about it; that is a good story,” said
Mpoko. He had heard it before.</p>

<p>In this forest region the air was so hot and
moist that such a thing as a drought was almost
unknown, but the people all knew what it was
like. Here the hot air took up the moisture
from the swamps and rivers, and the sun could
hardly get through the thick leaves of the
forest. But out on the plains, where there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
few trees, the sun beat down with a fierce heat
and the winds blew with a dry, hot fury that
made every water pool precious to man and
beast for miles around. Rivers that were deep
and swift in the rainy season dried up completely
in the dry season, and there were no
villages on the wide table-lands, because there
was no water there for months at a time. A
few people wandered about who lived as they
could by hunting, and the river villages, in
which families lived in houses and kept goats,
fowls, and cattle, had nothing to do with these
wild savages.</p>

<p>It was a drought such as the people of the
plains knew in the dry season that the Alo Man
meant when he began to tell the story of the
Jackal and the Drought.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I often remember [he said] the very dry
time in the land when many animals died of
thirst. It was in the days when the animals
lived in villages and talked one with another,
and when the drought was over the Lion called
the animals together and said that some plan
must be found to keep this from ever happening
again.</p>

<p>The Ape said that they might go to some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
country where there were no droughts, but the
Tortoise said that he would never live to complete
such a long journey.</p>

<p>“Let us sleep through the next dry season,”
said the Snake.</p>

<p>“That would never suit me,” said the Hare.</p>

<p>At last, after a great deal of discussion, the
Jackal and the Hyena suggested that they
might all join in digging a great pool to hold
water through the next dry season.</p>

<p>This seemed a wise plan, and on the very next
day the animals came to dig the hole.</p>

<p>They agreed to take turns. It was settled
that as the Hyena and the Jackal had made the
plan, the Hyena should be first and the Jackal
last; but when the Jackal’s turn came he was
nowhere to be found. The pool was almost
finished, and the others decided to go on and
get it done without him. Soon the rain began
to fall, and filled it full of pure, sweet water.
Then a rule was made that no one except those
who had helped to dig the pool should be allowed
to drink there.</p>

<p>The Jackal was hiding in the bushes and
heard all that was said, and he came very early
the next morning and drank all that he wanted.
Every morning, before any one else was about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
he did this, and after a while he grew bolder
and took a swim in the pool, so that the water
was muddy when the others came to drink.</p>

<p>“Who did this?” asked the Lion.</p>

<p>“Who did this?” asked the Leopard.</p>

<p>“Who did this?” asked all the other animals
when they came to drink.</p>

<p>But no one knew.</p>

<p>“I will tell you what we can do,” said the
Tortoise. “Cover my shell with beeswax to
make it sticky, and I will watch all night by the
pool and catch the rascal.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_063.jpg"
 alt="jackal and tortoise">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>So the shell of the Tortoise was covered with
a thick coat of sticky wax, and he took his place
beside the pool to watch for trespassers. He
drew his head and his tail and his feet inside his
shell, so that he looked like a flat brown stone.
From time to time he would stick his head out
cautiously to see if any one was coming. After
waiting all night long, he heard a noise in the
bushes. He crept down to the very edge of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
water, drew his head and feet into his shell, and
kept as still as a stone.</p>

<p>Then the Jackal came sneaking down to the
pool, looking from side to side to make sure that
no one was set to guard it.</p>

<p>“What a very convenient stepping-stone,” he
said, and he placed his two fore feet upon the
Tortoise’s shell and bent down to drink. No
sooner had he done this than he discovered, to
his great surprise and terror, that his feet were
stuck fast.</p>

<p>“Ow! Ow! Let me go! This is a mean
trick!” howled the Jackal.</p>

<p>“You are not the only one who knows how
to play tricks,” said the Tortoise, and he began
to move away.</p>

<p>“Yah! Yah! Let me go!” yelled the Jackal.
“If you don’t let me go, I will kick your shell
to pieces with my hind feet.”</p>

<p>“You may do just as you please about that,”
said the Tortoise, moving on away from the
pool.</p>

<p>The Jackal kicked as hard as he could at the
Tortoise with his hind feet, and first one and then
the other stuck fast to the shell.</p>

<p>“Wow! Wow! Let me go!” squalled the
Jackal. “If you don’t let me go, I will bite you
in two!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
“Try it and see what happens,” said the
Tortoise quietly, moving on along the path.</p>

<p>The Jackal bit the shell as hard as he could,
and his jaws stuck to it fast. He was dragged
along, until, after some time, the Tortoise arrived
at the Lion’s house and told how he had caught
the thieving Jackal.</p>

<p>All the animals, when they heard the news,
gathered to see the Jackal in his miserable
captivity, but not one of them had any pity for
him. Every one said that he ought to die for
his dishonesty and his mischief-making.</p>

<p>“You may live until tomorrow,” said the
Lion, “and we will allow you this favor: you
may choose the way you will die.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the Jackal, meekly. Then
he began to think whether there was not some
plan by which he might escape even now.</p>

<p>All the animals came to see the Jackal executed,
and the Hyena was made the executioner.</p>

<p>“Have you made up your mind in what way
you wish to be killed?” asked the Lion.</p>

<p>“I once saw a monkey kill a rat,” said the
Jackal, “by swinging it round by the tail and
dashing it against a tree. I think I should
prefer to be killed in that way.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the Lion, “the Hyena will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
take you by the tail and swing you round and
round and dash you against a tree.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the Jackal, meekly. “If
I might be so free as to make a suggestion,
permit me to say that the other animals might
be safer if they sat as far away as possible.
Otherwise, when the Hyena lets go of me, I
might hit one of them instead of the tree, and
that would be very unfortunate.”</p>

<p>The animals thought that this was a good
suggestion, and went as far away as they could
go without being out of sight of the execution.</p>

<p>Now the Jackal had saved some fat from the
meat they gave him for his dinner, and he had
greased his tail all the way to the tip, so that it
was as slippery as a lump of butter.</p>

<p>The Hyena grasped the Jackal firmly by the
tail and began to swing him round his head
with all his might, but the harder he swung the
more quickly the tail slipped out of his hand.
In spite of all he could do, the Hyena could not
keep hold of the slippery tail, and before he
knew what had happened, the Jackal had landed
on the ground and was running away through
the forest for dear life. As for the Hyena, he
lost his grip so suddenly that he was upset
entirely, and sat down hard against a tree.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
And as for the other animals, they were so surprised
that not one of them started to run after
the Jackal until he was out of sight.</p>

<p>The Jackal never came back to disturb the
waters of the pool. A long time after every one
who had helped to build it was dead, it was
still known to all the animals of the forest, and
it never was dry even in the hottest weather.
But the Tortoises never forgot how the Jackal
came to steal the water from the pool, and if
you were to go there now you would probably
find one of them on the bank, watching to see
that no one troubles the waters.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Did you find that one there?” asked Mpoko.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Alo Man, rubbing the last
bit of red clay into some curious marks on the
shell of the little tortoise he had been decorating.
“I found him by a pool where all the animals
drink, looking exactly like a little brown stone
in the mud.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Six">VI</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="ls">WHY THE CANOE UPSET</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> mist of the river still hung in the air
in the gray morning light. Early as it
was, the men of the village were astir, making
ready for their expedition. Mpoko and Nkula,
rubbing their eyes, made a hasty breakfast and
scampered down to the river bank with their
fishing tackle.</p>

<p>The boys had two new scoop nets, which
Nkunda had helped to make. Like all the
children of the village, they could do all sorts of
things with fiber string, and could even make
the string. Hibiscus fiber, braided palm leaves,
thongs, and bark, all were used for string, thread,
or cord as each happened to be wanted. Strands
of fiber were made into string by rolling with
the hand, on the thigh. Mpoko and Nkunda
and Nkula, and even their younger playmates,
could make any number of cat’s cradles. One
looked like a locust, another like a grass hut with
four sides and a pointed top; and another was
called “The Bed.” The Alo Man had taught
them one named for the great zigzag valley of
the Zambezi—the Batoka Gorge, below the
Victoria Falls, which are three times as high as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
Niagara. The Alo Man could also make the
Moon figure, the Moon darkened, the Fighting
Lions and the Parrot Cage; and the boys knew
figures called the Fish Trap, the Pit, and the
Calabash Net.</p>

<p>Mpoko knew exactly how he should go about
his fishing, although he had never fished in the
part of the river where he and Nkula were
going that morning. He was always the leader
in their sports, and as they squatted on the end
of a canoe waiting for the men to come, he
explained his plan all over again. They would
fish in two ways. First, they would look for a
pool or backwater where the current was not
as strong as it was in mid-channel. In the
water, but near the bank, they would build
little lattice-work fences, about eighteen inches
apart. Then they would take the larger of their
nets and find some rocks on which to stand while
they dipped the net into the water with the
mouth upstream. Fish swimming downstream
would swim into the net and be caught. Then
the boys would lift the net out and lay the fish
on the rocks to dry. There were said to be
plenty of little fish something like whitebait in
that part of the river, and if they had good
luck, there would be fresh fish for supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>When they were tired of this way of fishing,
they would take the smaller nets and go back
to the pool where they had built their fences,
and here they might find some small fish that
had come in between the fences and could not
find their way out. The small nets would
scoop up these little fish quite easily.</p>

<p>Mpoko knew as well as any one that it is not
very wise to count your fish while they are still
in the river, but he could not help making a
guess at the number they might get in a whole
day’s fishing. The men heard him and grinned
as they started to push off the canoes.</p>

<p>The boats were heavy, but they rode well in
the water. They were worked by means of
paddles, and each was made of a single tree
trunk hollowed out. The people of this thatch-roofed
village had no knowledge of carpenter
work. Whatever they made of wood was cut
out of the solid block with their adzes. In this
way they would chisel out a log until a good-sized
hollow had been formed; then hot stones
were placed in it to burn out a deeper hole.
When the stones cooled, they were heated again
to be put back after the charred wood was
scraped away; this was done over and over, until
the canoe was deep enough to be seaworthy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
Sometimes the ends were carved to look like
the head of some animal. The paddles also were
sometimes decorated with chip-carving. The
African dugout is not so graceful as the birch
canoe, but it has some advantages of its own.
The Congo is a peculiar river.</p>

<p>One reason why so much of Africa is still wild
country, some of it not even explored, is that
there are so many falls in the rivers. Boats cannot
go up from the sea to the interior unless
they are light enough to be carried round the
falls. And boats that are small enough for this
are too small to be of much use in carrying goods
for trading or large parties of settlers. Another
reason is that so much of the country is either
dense jungle or waterless plain. Almost the
only way to carry goods into the Upper Congo
country is by porters, who have to follow narrow
trails, in single file.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_071.jpg"
 alt="boy crossing bridge">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
Where such a trail crosses a river too deep
to ford,—and in flood time African rivers are
likely to be deep,—of course there must be a
bridge. The wild people are clever at making
woven bridges. To be sure, these bridges are
not wide enough for horses or wagons, but there
are no horses or wagons to go over them, so that
makes no difference. Travelers pay something
for the privilege of using such a bridge, while
the men of the country near by keep it in
order. It was to repair a bridge that the men
of Mpoko’s village were going downstream now.</p>

<p>The canoes shot swiftly down with the current.
The two boys, with their keen black eyes, saw
all sorts of interesting things by the way. Once
they disturbed a hippopotamus having one of
his daily baths. His great mouth looked as if
he could swallow them whole, but he was much
more scared than they were. Once the strange,
whiskered, black and white face of a colobus
monkey peered out of a tree top. Then a
crowned crane, his feathered crest very erect,
rose out of the swamp and flapped away, his
long legs trailing behind him. Even as early
as this the sun was blazing hot as a furnace
and the mist had burned quite away.</p>

<p>There was no need to paddle; the men had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
all they could do to steer the canoes as they
rode on the strong current. At last they shot
round a bend of the river and into the shadow
of the bridge and scrambled ashore.</p>

<p>The bridge was made of saplings firmly lashed
together and had a handrail of rattan. It hung
from the great trees on the two sides of the
river, high above even the reach of a flood. A
log bridge might have been swept away by the
caving of the banks in flood time, and the people
could not possibly have built a stone bridge or
an iron one.</p>

<p>When the traders were coming back from
their last journey, they had noticed that the
supports of the bridge were rather shaky, and
as they meant to send a much larger caravan
over it before long, they wanted to make sure
that all was in order.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_073.jpg"
 alt="heron in flight">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
Over narrow streams, bridges are sometimes
made of a bundle of slim tree trunks lashed
together and resting on the banks, but here the
river was too wide for that. Farther down,
the banks of the Lower Congo are steep hills, a
mile and a quarter apart, and through this
funnel-like channel the Upper Congo and its
tributary streams pour their waters into a tremendous
whirlpool known as the Devil’s Cook
Pot. None of the men of the village had ever
seen this awful place, but they had heard of it,
and many were the tales told of the dangers of
the unknown waters toward which their river
flowed through the wilderness.</p>

<p>While the men worked at the lashings of the
timbers and the closer knotting of the ropes, the
boys went about their fishing. They did not
have much trouble in finding a suitable shallow
place for their little wicker fences, but when
they came to fish with the scoop net, Mpoko
discovered that he had not reckoned on the
strength of the stream. His best net was
whirled away out of his hand before he had used
it twice. Thereafter the boys had to take turns,
one using the remaining large net while the
other fished in the shallows.</p>

<p>Their misfortunes did not end there. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
had just gathered all their little fishes into a
woven basket, when Nkula darted back from
the river with a startled shout, and Mpoko
turned just in time to see net, fish, and all
vanish into the long, wicked jaws of a crocodile.</p>

<p>The boys were in luck, as one of the men told
them, not to have gone into the crocodile’s
stomach themselves. All the same, they felt
very cheap to be going home with only a few
mean little fish for the whole day’s work.</p>

<p>The bridge had now been put in order, and
as the party took boat again for home, several
crocodile stories were told. Every one of the
men had had some experience with the Terror
of the Waters. They all knew how he would
lie for hours in the mud with only his nose in
sight, looking exactly like a fallen log, and how
his hoarse call could sometimes be heard in the
swamp through the whole night. The boys felt
secretly glad to be on the way home in a solid,
well-balanced log canoe.</p>

<p>It was slower work returning than it had been
coming down the river, and the paddles worked
steadily. When they had traveled some distance,
a hunter from another village hailed them
from the trail. He had a wild pig that he did
not wish to carry home and after a little bargaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
the bridge menders paid for it and it was
tumbled into the canoe. As one of the men
said slyly, roast pork for supper would do very
well, seeing that the boys had not caught enough
fish to make a showing!</p>

<p>At home, in the village, the women had come
in and were at work as usual preparing supper.
A little before sunset, far down the river, the
voices of men singing came over the water, and
as the song grew louder they could make out
something about roast pig for supper.</p>

<p>“They must have killed something,” said
Nkunda.</p>

<p>“The boys have had bad luck with their
fishing,” said the Alo Man, whose keen ears had
caught the little jeering note in the song.</p>

<p>In another minute the canoes would come in
sight round the bend in the river, when—all
at once—there was a great splash and a chorus
of yells, and the song broke off in the middle of
a line. When the canoes presently appeared,
the men were no longer singing; they were
paddling with all their might, and they looked
rather scared and crestfallen.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
 <img src="images/i_077.jpg"
 alt="Men in river">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Mpoko and Nkula, however, did not look
crestfallen. They grinned as only small African
boys can grin, as they hopped out of the canoe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
and scampered for the huts with their few but
precious fish.</p>

<p>“Where is that roast pork we were going to
have for supper?” asked the Alo Man, coming
to meet the party.</p>

<p>“We were nearly home when a crocodile rose
up almost under the canoe, snapped at the pig,
tipped us over, and went off with the meat,”
growled one of the men.</p>

<p>Thus, after all, there would not have been
nearly so good a supper that night if the boys
had not gone fishing.</p>

<p>Crocodile stories were naturally in order after
supper, and the Alo Man, when his turn came,
told the story of the Rabbit and the Crocodile.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I always like to tell of the time, long and long
ago, when the creatures lived in towns like
people, and had their own farms.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_078.jpg"
 alt="rabbit an crocodile">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The Crocodile had a farm by the river, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
he used to come up on land when he liked.
One day, as he lay sunning himself on his farm,
the Rabbit saw him.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Uncle?” said the Rabbit,
edging up toward him. “You seem to be taking
life easy. All you have to do is to sleep, and
eat, and bathe, and enjoy yourself.”</p>

<p>“Let me alone,” grunted the Crocodile, who
was sleepy. And he shut his eyes.</p>

<p>Close to the Crocodile’s nose there grew a nice
juicy bunch of young plantains.</p>

<p>“How good those leaves do look!” thought
the Rabbit. “And there they grow and flourish
under the very nose of a creature who never
eats them. I wonder if I could not get just one
good bite, and then run?”</p>

<p>The Rabbit crept up closer and closer, but
just as he was going to nibble at the leaves, the
Crocodile woke up and yelled at him.</p>

<p>“Get away from here, you little thief!” he
roared, and he snapped so savagely with his
sharp, white, pointed teeth that the Rabbit ran
faster than he had ever thought he possibly could
run, and never stopped until he reached home.</p>

<p>He told his wife and children about the selfish
old Crocodile, who was so full of dinner that he
could not keep awake and who would not let a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
hungry little Rabbit nibble the leaves that he
did not want himself. When the little Rabbits
heard why they had no supper that night, they
had a great deal to say about the Crocodile.</p>

<p>“That is all very well,” said the Rabbit,
“but when a chicken is the judge, the cockroach
gets no justice. We cannot depend on any one
else to punish the Crocodile; we must do it
ourselves. Come all of you and get dry grass
and leaves, and we will go and lay them in a
circle around the Crocodile while he is asleep,
and then we will set them on fire. We’ll give
him a fine scare.”</p>

<p>Then all the Rabbits wriggled with joy and
kicked up their heels at the thought of what
was going to happen, and they gathered many
armfuls of grass and leaves and laid them in
a circle round the Crocodile. The fire was
kindled, and it began to blaze up and smoke.
The Rabbits hid themselves in the bushes and
kept as still as stones.</p>

<p>Crackle—crackle—snap-snap-snap! went
the fire, but the Crocodile did not wake up.</p>

<p>Snap! snap! snap! went the burning twigs,
but the Crocodile did not wake up.</p>

<p>The smoke began to get thicker and blacker,
until at last they could not see the Crocodile,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
but they heard him cough in his sleep. Then
he turned over, and coughed again.</p>

<p>“Haugh! Haugh! What’s the matter here?
I can’t breathe!” grunted the Crocodile.</p>

<p>Then he choked, and coughed, and opened
his mouth so wide that a live coal flew into it.
At that he woke up completely. He made a
rush to get away from the fire, but found it in
front of him. He turned round, and saw it
still in front of him, while at the same time it
was behind him scorching the end of his tail.
Then he made one big jump and got out of the
circle of fire, and his hide was so thick that he
was hardly burned at all, but he was badly
scared and very angry. When he heard all
the squealing and laughter of the Rabbits in the
bushes, he was so angry he could hardly speak.</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever dare to come near the river
again!” he shouted, and off he waddled as fast
as he could go, to get into the cool water and put
mud on his burned places.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_081.jpg"
 alt="river shoreline">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>“Don’t you ever dare to come up here on the
land again!” squealed the Rabbits, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
set about gathering the plantains and other
vegetables on the Crocodile’s farm where the
fire had not come.</p>

<p>And from that day to this the Rabbits never
go near the river if they can help it, and the
Crocodile never goes far from the river if he can
help it. He does not like to be reminded of the
time when he was caught in the fire by a trick
and the Rabbits laughed at him, for the news
went from one tongue to another, and the
Crocodile has never heard the last of it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Seven">VII</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="ls">THE TRAIL OF THE ELEPHANT</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> farms around the village were good to
have, but the real storehouse of the people
was the forest. The forests of the Congo form
one of the largest tree-clad regions of the world.
More rubber vines are found there than in any
other place.</p>

<p>Yams, plantains, and pineapples grow wild in
the forest. Coffee now grows wild in many
parts of Africa, although it was not till 1876
that Scotch planters brought the first coffee
tree to Africa, from the Edinburgh Botanical
Gardens. Cotton grows without being cultivated
and is sometimes woven on native looms;
but lately the cloth from overseas, that is sold
in twelve-yard pieces by the traders, is much
more popular.</p>

<p>Among the things grown on the farms are
cassava, maize, rice, peanuts, sweet potatoes,
bananas, beans, sugar-cane, tobacco, coffee,
according to the nature of the soil. Rubber is
almost the only product that sells for a price
which makes it worth while to carry it two days’
journey to a market.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
<p>Ivory is in great demand by traders, but
when an elephant is killed the ivory belongs to
the king of the country. He has his workmen
and artists make it into carved and ornamented
articles. When the king dies, all this collection
of carved ivory is destroyed; for this reason
carved ivory that a trader can buy is rare in
Equatorial Africa. Much uncarved ivory is
also hoarded.</p>

<p>The people of Mpoko’s village traded rubber,
palm oil, and sometimes raffia. They were now
getting ready for a great journey to the trading
station far down the river. All the river villages
would share in this expedition, and there would
be perhaps one hundred and fifty men in all.
One chief might go himself, with as many men
as were needed to carry his goods; another would
send a trusted man in charge of ten or fifteen
porters; another might send his men with their
loads in charge of a friend, and so on. So strong
a company would be able to travel through the
wilderness without much fear of wild beasts or
of human enemies.</p>

<p>In a great part of wild Africa, slave-raiding
has always gone on more or less, and the forest
paths are never really safe. Mpoko and Nkunda
had heard their mother tell of a little sister of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
own who was sent to the market four miles
away to buy a saucepan, and on the way home,
straying from the party with whom she went,
had been lost and never again heard of. There
were people they knew who had been slaves
themselves, or had lost a mother, father, or
friend in this way. A person carried off by the
slave trader would never be able to get home
again or to find people who talked his own
language. There are no maps, no letters, no
police, no common language in these wild places.
A great shadow is over all the land, the shadow
of constant danger.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_085.jpg"
 alt="slaves bound by chain">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>All things considered, the beasts of the forest
are less feared than human enemies. In all the
Alo Man’s stories, the animals behaved as they
did in the old days when the world was new and
there was order in the land. Each tribe had
its king; the elephant, of course, was king of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
the large animals; the largest of the eagles was
king of the birds; a certain large fish was king
of the fishes; and there was a king also of the
locusts and one of the ants.</p>

<p>But for all that he was the king of the largest
animals, the Elephant did not always get the
better of the others, as is shown in the story of
the Elephant and the Rabbit. The Alo Man
had been watching the boys playing at trading;
suddenly he began to tell the story.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Rabbit said to the Elephant [The Alo
Man began], “Let us go into partnership.”</p>

<p>“But I am so much stronger than you,” said
the Elephant.</p>

<p>“And I am so much more nimble than you,”
said the Rabbit.</p>

<p>[The children began to laugh, for that was
exactly how the boys had argued when they
began to quarrel in their game. They all
gathered about the Alo Man to hear the story,
and soon everybody felt quite good-natured.]</p>

<p>After a great deal of talk the Rabbit and the
Elephant decided to become partners, and sell
nuts, manioc root, and bananas.</p>

<p>“I am carrying a much larger load than you
are,” said the Elephant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
“But I go so much faster than you do,” said
the Rabbit, as he skipped along under his small
load.</p>

<p>After a while they came to a river, and the
Rabbit, who does not like to wet his feet, asked
the Elephant to carry him across. The Elephant,
however, said that he had a heavy enough
load already, and he waded into the river.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” said the Rabbit, cheerfully,
and finding a shallow place he hopped from one
rock to another until he reached the far side.</p>

<p>When they came to the village, the people
were glad to see the Rabbit, but they were afraid
of the Elephant because he looked so cross.</p>

<p>“What will you give me for my nuts?” asked
the Rabbit.</p>

<p>“We will give you these cowries,” said the
people, and they took all his nuts. But they
bought very little from the Elephant.</p>

<p>It was the same everywhere. The Elephant
growled and grumbled, and rocked from one side
to the other, and had very little success, while
the Rabbit sold all his wares at good prices.
In the end the Rabbit had a large bag of cowries
and the Elephant had only a little one.</p>

<p>When they started home, the Elephant said:
“It is not right for you to have the large bag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
and for me to have the small one. If any one
should ask you, say that the large bag is mine.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the Rabbit.</p>

<p>Soon they met some travelers, and when the
travelers saw the two bags of cowries, they asked
the Rabbit if the large one was his, and when he
said it was, they laughed. After they had passed
by the Elephant said, “I told you to say that the
large bag was mine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, so you did,” said the Rabbit. “I
forgot.”</p>

<p>The Elephant was growing more and more
angry, and he said to himself, “What if I leave
him to travel alone with his big bag of cowries?
We shall see how long he will keep it.”</p>

<p>At the next bend in the trail the Elephant
turned aside into the forest. Soon he met a
Lion, and said to him, “A Rabbit back there is
traveling alone with a large bag of cowries.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_088.jpg"
 alt="lion and elephant">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>“Good!” said the Lion. “I will eat that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
Rabbit and carry off his treasure,” and away
he bounded through the forest.</p>

<p>Then the Elephant met a Buffalo, and said to
him, “A silly little Rabbit back there has a large
bag of cowries.”</p>

<p>“That is very pleasant,” said the Buffalo.
“I will kill that Rabbit and steal his treasure,”
and off he trampled through the swamp.</p>

<p>Soon the Elephant met a Hyena, and said to
him, “There is a foolish young Rabbit all alone
back there with a great bag of cowries.”</p>

<p>“How kind of you!” said the Hyena. “I
will crack the bones of that Rabbit and get his
treasure,” and off he trotted across the plain.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Lion and the Rabbit had
met.</p>

<p>The Lion gave a great roar and was making
ready to spring, when the Rabbit said gayly,
“How have you slept, Uncle? I am going to
the great feast that the King of the Monkeys is
giving, and I shall buy good things with some of
these cowries. Don’t you want to come, too?”</p>

<p>The Lion thought that it would be much better
to attend this feast than to eat a few mouthfuls
of Rabbit; so he said, “Thank you, I shall be
proud to go with you,” and they trotted along
together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
Then the Buffalo came crashing through the
bushes with his horns lowered, but the Rabbit
said gayly, “Have you slept well, Uncle? I am
going to the great feast that the King of the
Monkeys is giving, and I shall buy good things
with some of these cowries. Don’t you want
to join us?”</p>

<p>The Buffalo thought that it would be much
better to attend this feast than to gore the
Rabbit; so he said, “Thank you, I shall be
proud to go with you,” and they all went on
together.</p>

<p>Then the Hyena slunk out of the tall grass
and showed his teeth, but the Rabbit said
gayly, “I hope you have slept well, Uncle.
I am going to the great feast that the King of
the Monkeys is giving, and I shall buy good
things with some of these cowries. Will you
not come with us?”</p>

<p>The Hyena thought that it would be much
better to attend this feast than to pick the
bones of a small Rabbit; so he said, “Thank
you, I shall be proud to go with you,” and all
four went on in company.</p>

<p>When they reached the forest where the King
of the Monkeys lived, the Rabbit asked them to
wait while he told the King who had come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
his feast. He found the King of the Monkeys,
and told the whole story and asked for help.</p>

<p>When the other three animals came up, the
King of the Monkeys welcomed them graciously,
and said to the Lion, “The feast is ready except
for certain small things. Will you do me the
favor to find me a log with smooth bark? That
is the only sort of wood that will roast the meat
which we shall serve at this feast.”</p>

<p>Off bounded the Lion to find a log with smooth
bark.</p>

<p>“And you,” he said to the Buffalo, “will you
do me the favor of finding some young banana
leaves that have fallen? Then we shall have
suitable plates for the meat when it is
cooked.”</p>

<p>Off galloped the Buffalo to find some young
leaves fallen from a banana tree.</p>

<p>“And you, Uncle,” said the King to the
Hyena, “will you do me the favor of finding a
spring with spouting water? That is the only
kind of water in which we can boil the vegetables.”</p>

<p>Off ran the Hyena to find a spring of spouting
water.</p>

<p>All night the three animals hunted and could
not find what they had been sent to get, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
the morning they came back very tired and
humble.</p>

<p>“You do not seem to care to come to my
feast,” said the King of the Monkeys, severely.</p>

<p>“I hunted all through the forest,” said the
Lion, licking his paws.</p>

<p>“I sat under banana trees all night long,”
said the Buffalo, shivering.</p>

<p>“I watched the mouth of the spring until the
moon went down,” said the Hyena, yawning
as if his jaws would break in two.</p>

<p>“You lazy fellows, I have heard enough of
your excuses!” shouted the King of the Monkeys,
and all the Monkeys, who had gathered above
in the trees, began to throw down sticks and
large nuts and to chatter so fiercely that the
Lion, the Buffalo, and the Hyena started out
of the forest at full speed and never came back.
Then the King of the Monkeys and the little
Rabbit laughed and laughed and laughed, until
they were tired.</p>

<p>But sometimes, even now, when the Lion,
the Buffalo, and the Hyena meet, they discuss
the question whether there is any such thing
as a log with smooth bark, or a banana tree
whose leaves fall when they are just coming out,
or a spring with spouting waters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
All the listeners laughed as loud and long as
the Rabbit and the King of the Monkeys. Then
they began to argue the question who was
really the king of all the animals, and from that
they discussed who would be the headman of the
caravan when it should start out. The Alo
Man got up and shook the rattles on his drum.</p>

<p>“They will meet some one at the end of the
first day’s journey who will make them all run,—headman
and porter, sick and well alike,” he
said.</p>

<p>There were various guesses, but nobody
guessed right.</p>

<p>“The Hill-that-goes-down-quick,” said the
Alo Man, holding his hand at a slope of about
half a right angle, and there was a general shout,
for everybody remembered the steep hill just
beyond the bridge. Truly, as the Alo Man said,
that would make any man run.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night, when everybody
was asleep, Mpoko awoke suddenly and sat
straight up. At first he thought he must be
dreaming of the Elephant and the other animals,
for he could hear chewing and trampling and
thrashing about in the edge of the forest. Peering
out in the moonlight, he could see big
shadowy backs moving about near the granary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
and it did not take him a second to run out,
shouting “Njoku! Njoku!”</p>

<p>The Alo Man heard him and was out in a
minute. His father heard him and snatched
up his spear and ran out, knocking up the other
men. Almost before the dogs could begin to
bark, the little village was as lively as an ant-hill.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_094.jpg"
 alt="man carrying tusk">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Now the elephant, for all his size, is not a
ferocious animal, and these elephants had come
across that village only by accident. The three
or four that were browsing about in the hope
of finding something good were more surprised
by the people than the people had been by them.
In no very great time they went off, splashing
and trampling and trumpeting through the
forest. They left the maize field, however, in
bad shape, and some of the huts were in worse
shape still, for the elephants had gone right
through them. When the timbers and thatch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
pricked the big creatures, they were more than
ever willing to go away from that place at once.</p>

<p>The hunters of the village had no mind to
lose this chance. Waiting only to provide themselves
with food, they set off on the trail, and
managed during the next day to head the elephants
round toward a pit they knew of which
made a most effective elephant trap. Here
they caught two large elephants with splendid
tusks, and they came home in triumph with
news of meat enough to provide a feast for the
whole village, and a store of ivory for the king
which was worth many brass rods.</p>

<h4 class="ls">THE CUSTOMS OF THE ANTS</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> following days were busy indeed in the
village. There were so many things to
see and to do that it was hard for any boy or
girl to keep up with the times.</p>

<p>If one stayed to watch the women preparing
the meat of the elephant for the great feast,
one would miss the expedition into the forest
to cut poles for new houses, and would not see
the putting up of the framework and the construction
of the roof. Nkunda spent some time
helping to make the mud to plaster the walls of
her mother’s house, and any child who ever
dabbled in mud and water with the feet knows
how pleasant that is. Other children collected
split bamboos and wet bark rope, and grass for
thatching.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_096.jpg"
 alt="boy playing in mud">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
The house Mpoko and Nkunda saw going up
was built without the use of nails or hammers or
saws, planes, screws or chisels, foot rule or
figures. First, a row of strong poles was
planted along the line of the house wall and as
high as the eaves would be—a little less than
five feet. The mud floor inside was tramped
down hard, and was a little higher than the level
of the ground outside. The three forked posts
supporting the ridgepole were about seven feet
high.</p>

<p>Of course there were children who did not
know the old riddle about the ridgepole posts.
When Mpoko told them that there were three
men carrying a dead one in their teeth over
yonder, they ran very fast to the place at which
he pointed. All that they saw, however, was
three “king posts” just set up, with the ridgepole
lying across them; and then they remembered
that the forks of such a post are called
<i>meno</i>, which means teeth. Then they went and
found other children who had not heard the riddle
and brought them to see; and before the roof
was on, the joke had been told four or five
times.</p>

<p>It was not hard to build little huts in the
same way the men were putting up the big ones,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
and when a group of children had just finished
one Nkunda came by from the hen house.</p>

<p>“I have a house built without any door,”
said she. “The person who lives in it will
come out when he is hungry.”</p>

<p>Nobody could guess that riddle until Nkunda
opened her little brown hand and showed them
a new-laid egg.</p>

<p>“I know a riddle you have not heard,” said
Nkula. “My father’s fowls laid their eggs
under the leaves.”</p>

<p>None of them had heard that one, but Nkunda
happened to remember seeing Nkula munching
peanuts a few minutes before and called
out triumphantly, “Nguba!” Of course, the
peanut, or “goober,” hides its fruit under its
leaves.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_098.jpg"
 alt="examining peanuts">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>“The bird with its head cut off eats up all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
the food,” said their mother. The answer to
that was easy when one saw the women grinding
flour for bread. The stone on which grain,
cassava, and plantains are pounded was the
headless bird.</p>

<p>Then the Alo Man told them one that was new
to them all.</p>

<p>“I went to a strange town and they gave me
one-legged fowls to eat.” The answer was
“Mushrooms.” Another new riddle was this:
“A small stick may have many leaves and lose
them all in a day.” The stick was a market,
and the leaves were the people.</p>

<p>With laughter and joking and singing, all the
work went on, and before long the men were
finishing the house walls. They bound split
bamboo crosswise of the posts with wet bark
rope, which shrinks as it dries and will last for
years. The women plastered the wall inside
and out with the mud which they had made at
the nearest ant-hill by puddling earth and
water with their feet. This mud was squeezed
between the bamboos, and when it was dry,
more was put on, until the walls were quite
rain-proof.</p>

<p>When the walls were dry the frame of the roof,
which had been made separately, was set on top,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
and then the grass thatching was tied on in
bundles, the upper row overlapping the lower
as wooden shingles do. The rafters of the roof
were the midribs of the raffia leaf. The house
was divided within into the side for sleep and
the side for fire.</p>

<p>In chilly weather a wood fire smoldered inside
each hut, so that the walls and inside of the roof
became black and shining with soot. The
houses were used only to sleep in, to sit in on
rainy days, and to hold various stores which
must be kept dry; all the cooking, eating, and
general work of the family were done outside.
Moreover, a whole family did not live in a single
house. Each grown person had a separate
hut, the children usually staying with their
mothers.</p>

<p>There was almost no furniture except that
some houses had a mud platform with a grass
bed on it. When the headman of the village
presided on any formal occasion, he sat on a low
stool cut out of a solid block of wood. The rest
of the people sat on their heels and were perfectly
comfortable, for they had always sat in
that position. Food was served in wooden
platters and calabashes, without tables.
Baskets and jars served to hold things, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
there were no stoves, cupboards, bureaus, washstands,
desks, sofas, or sideboards. The people
made what they needed and wanted, and spent
no time taking care of anything they did not
want.</p>

<p>The village was fairly clean, for the dogs,
fowls, and goats and the wild birds and animals
ate up a great deal of garbage. If rubbish accumulated,
it was carried off into the forest at
certain times. There was always enough to
eat of one kind of food or another, and enough
to trade, for most of the things really needed
could always be found in the great storehouse
of the wilderness. If there had never been
anything to be afraid of, the people would have
lived comfortably year in and year out. But
the shadow of danger was always hanging over
them.</p>

<p>The men of the village had had a great deal
of talk with the Alo Man about this fear of
attack, and he was able to tell them several
things about the ways of defending a country
and of avoiding trouble, which he had seen in
his travels. He had been among many different
tribes, and some of the customs of which he told
seemed very strange.</p>

<p>For instance, the Alo Man said that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
Wa-nkonda built their huts round, with the
walls sloping out from the bottom like a basket,
and the spaces between the bamboos were not
plastered with mud but filled in with round bricks
of white clay. This seemed to Mpoko and
Nkunda like a great deal of needless trouble,
but the Alo Man assured them that the Wa-nkonda
would think their huts just as strange
and outlandish. In some tribes the warriors
used daggers with the ring-shaped hilt, and
shields of hide or leather, and some preferred
the bow and arrow to the spear. The Alo Man
had seen a king’s palace eighteen feet by twenty-five,
with plank walls and thatched roof. This
king owned ivory bows carved at the ends; the
ivory would have snapped like a dry twig in any
temperate climate, but the hot steamy air of
Equatorial Africa kept it elastic. The same
king had double drinking horns made of a pair
of eland horns mounted in ivory; he had oil
dishes of carved ivory shaped like little canoes
or handled cups, and his women had combs and
hairpins of carved ivory. The Alo Man had
been a guest at a royal banquet, at which they
served soup, sweet potatoes, greens, fish, boiled
chicken, boiled pork, roast pig, rice pudding,
and stewed guava. The women of the village<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
were proud to find that their own feast would
have nearly everything on this list and a few
other dishes besides.</p>

<p>Mpoko had reached an age when he was
beginning to wonder about the reason for things,
and he wondered a great deal about the constant
danger of raids from enemies outside. He
knew that he himself would probably be headman
some day, for his mother was of a family even
more important than his father’s, and it was
the mother’s rank that counted in such matters.
He asked the Alo Man some questions about the
best way of defending one’s village, and without
saying anything very definite in reply the Alo
Man went on to tell the story of the Quarrelsome
Ants. The story perhaps gained in interest
from the fact that several different kinds of
ants were just then busy in plain sight.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_103.jpg"
 alt="hunting tools">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
I often see things [the Alo Man began] that
remind me of the time when all the Ants met
together in palaver under a large tree, like this
one, to try to find some way of protecting themselves
from their enemies.</p>

<p>“We have more enemies than any other
creatures on earth,” groaned the Black Ants.</p>

<p>“We are perfectly helpless, whatever happens,”
wailed the Red Ants. “A Centipede
came to our village yesterday and ate up all our
slaves before we could do anything.”</p>

<p>“The other creatures are so large,” lamented
the Rice Ant. “They are provided with weapons
suited especially to hurt us. The Anteater
came to our hill and poked his long, slender
tongue down every corridor and into every hole,
and licked us up by the hundred.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_104.jpg"
 alt="anteater">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>“If you had ever known what it was to be
hunted by Birds,” said the Wagtail Ant, “you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
would think other enemies were hardly worth
minding.”</p>

<p>“It does not matter which enemy is the
worst,” said the Gray Ant. “What we have
to consider is the way to escape.”</p>

<p>“Let us live underground,” said the Rice
Ant.</p>

<p>“Our enemies can burrow faster than we can,”
said the Red Ant.</p>

<p>“It would be better to take to the trees,”
said the Black Ant.</p>

<p>“So it might, if you are ready to walk into
the mouth of some hungry Bird,” said the
Wagtail Ant.</p>

<p>“We can learn to fly,” said the Gray Ant.</p>

<p>“Birds fly much better than we ever could,”
said the Rice Ant.</p>

<p>“We shall have to come to earth to eat or
sleep,” said the Red Ant.</p>

<p>“And when we do, our enemies will all be
waiting for us,” said the Wagtail Ant.</p>

<p>“Then, since we cannot live underground, on
the ground, in the trees, or in the air, where
are we to live?” asked the Black Ant. “I see
no way but to fight.”</p>

<p>“How do you expect to fight a Centipede?”
asked the Red Ant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
“Or an Anteater?” asked the Red Ant.</p>

<p>“Or a great, pouncing Bird with a beak like
a spear?” asked the Wagtail Ant.</p>

<p>Each insisted that his own way of escape
would be effective and that every other plan
was foolish and dangerous.</p>

<p>“There is nothing for us to do,” said the Black
Ant at last, “but each to live as suits him best,
for we shall never agree on a way of living that
will suit us all. For my part, I intend to
fight.”</p>

<p>Then the Black Ant and his people fought
their way through the rest and departed in a
column across the country.</p>

<p>The Red Ant built a strong castle with hundreds
of winding passages and chambers, but
no sooner was it done than the Anteater saw it.
Clawing his way through the wall, he put in
his long, slender tongue and licked up the
inhabitants.</p>

<p>The Rice Ant burrowed under the earth,
but no sooner had the many worms and burrowing
insects learned of the new colony than they
came and ate not only the grown Ants but the
baby Ants and even the eggs.</p>

<p>The Wagtail Ant climbed the trees and hid
under the bark, but Birds with long, slender<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
beaks pried into every crack and nipped the
hidden Ants with their pincers.</p>

<p>The Gray Ant grew wings and learned to fly,
and although he succeeded in dodging the
Birds, he found that when he alighted and
tried to hide in the leaves, the web of a Hunting
Spider awaited him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the King of the Insects had heard
of their troubles, and he sent a message to the
Ants, saying: “You will find safety only in
union. Join all together, and, small as you are,
you will be safe.”</p>

<p>The Beetle, who was sent with the message,
started out bravely, but bumped into a tree and
hit himself a blow on the head which knocked
the message completely out of it. Thus the
Ants have never received the advice of the
King.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Many of the men of the village had been
listening to this story, and there was silence for
a time after the Alo Man had finished.</p>

<p>“It is true,” said one of the hunters at last,
“we quarrel a great deal among ourselves, and
we have not been able to agree with the other
villages even about this expedition.”</p>

<p>“But our own ways are the best,” said another.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
“Why should we change them for those of
others?”</p>

<p>“That is what the people of Satu’s village
say,” said the Alo Man.</p>

<p>“If there is ever a great meeting in which we
are to plan how to defend ourselves against
Tswki,” said Mpoko’s father, grimly, “I think
we shall have to begin by making a law like that
of the People of the Bandaged Faces.”</p>

<p>The others grinned, for they knew that
story; but Mpoko could not imagine what his
father meant, and there was no time just then
to ask.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Nine">IX</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="ls">THE FEAST IN THE VILLAGE</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">M<span class="smcap">poko</span> and Nkunda could not remember
any feast which was so great a feast as
the one that celebrated the killing of the elephants.
The preparation of food and the
cooking of it took nearly every dish, pot, and
pan to be found in the village. Some of these
were of wood, some of iron, some of pottery,
and some of basket-work. The framework of
the baskets used for food was sometimes of
wood, with thin strips of cane or narrow splints
woven in and out, and maybe a wooden rim.
Sometimes the white wood used for baskets and
dishes was stained black, and a pattern was cut
out by carving away the black surface, leaving
a raised black decoration on white. Baskets
could be so closely woven that they would hold
milk. Some were made in the form of a demijohn,
or bottle, and covered with rubber-like
juice to make them water-tight, and these
were generally used to hold beer.</p>

<p>The pottery used at the feast was partly plain
and partly decorated. Cooking pots and porridge
pots were straight-sided. Beer pots were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
shaped like an egg with a hole in the end. Water
jars were made oval with a spreading top, and
there were round pots to hold the fat, salt, and
spices used in cooking. Some of this ware was
colored red with oxide of iron, and some was
covered with a black glaze. It was made by
hand, without any potter’s wheel, dried in the
sun, and then burned in a wood fire.</p>

<p>The making of the round dishes or cups called
calabashes was even simpler. Some of them
were made of gourds with the inside scooped
out, and some were picked off a tree as they
were. The curious tree called the baobab,
which is one of the silk-cotton family of trees,
bears a large, gourdlike fruit which the natives
call monkey-bread. The shell is about the
right size and shape for dishes, bowls, and cups.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_110.jpg"
 alt="pottery">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>One of the most important articles needed
for the feast was palm oil, and it was good that
there was a large supply on hand. In so hot a
climate, with no ice or ice-boxes, it is out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
question to keep butter for use in cooking.
The palm oil is used for various purposes in
cooking in place of butter, fat, lard, or olive oil.
It is made from the fruit of the oil palm, which
is an olive-shaped, plumlike fruit with a kernel
inside a thick, fleshy outer envelope. The
fruit grows in long red and yellow clusters.
When the men have climbed up the palm tree
and brought down the bunches, the fruits are
cut off the main stem and cooked in water until
they are soft and the kernel is loosened from the
pulp. Then this pulp is pounded in a large
mortar to free the kernels, which are put aside
in a pile, and the thick, orange-colored, oily
mass is dumped into a hollow log of wood like
a trough. The log rests on crossed sticks so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
that it slopes at an angle of about forty-five
degrees, and a pan or jar is set under the lower
end to receive the oil. Hot stones are mixed
with the pulp, and the oil, thinned by the heat,
runs down into the jar. Sometimes the kernels
are eaten, and sometimes they are pounded up
to make more oil.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_111.jpg"
 alt="making butter">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Palm oil was used for other things besides
cooking. It could be burned in a homemade
lamp,—an earthen dish with a floating wick,—and
it was used for any ordinary purpose for
which oil is used. Finally, it served the purpose
of cold cream in massaging and oiling the skin.
Before a feast, or after any great exertion, it
was always used in this way, and the dancers
who were to entertain the company began quite
early to rub one another’s limbs with oil from
the little ornamental dishes of palm oil. However,
there was plenty of oil for all these uses,
without touching the supply in jars that would
be carried to the coast traders, to be used in
some far-away factory for making soap or
candles.</p>

<p>Presently the guests began to gather and the
musicians to play. Besides the drums with
their boom! boom! boom! there were several
other instruments—the sansi, a kind of wooden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
piano or xylophone, the marimba, another form
of the same thing, flutes made of hollow reed,
and a guitar-like instrument with the body of
it covered with skin. The dancers soon assembled,
and the rattles tied to their ankles
and the clapping of the hands of the spectators
kept time to the wild music. This entertainment
would go on all night, probably for two
or three nights.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_113.jpg"
 alt="musical instruments">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>When it was time for the feast to begin,
girls and boys went about first of all with water
in calabashes and jars, that every one might
rinse out his mouth and wash his hands before
eating. Mpoko and Nkunda had been taught
always to do this before a meal, and they had
also a kind of wooden toothbrush which kept
the teeth cleaner, if anything, than the ones
sold in shops. Some people say that the care
which these tribes take of their teeth is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
reason why they usually have such very white
and sound ones.</p>

<p>The men and women did not eat together.
The principal men were served first, and after
they had taken what they chose from the
dishes, the women and children had the rest in
their turn. Meat and gravy were cooked in one
dish, dumplings, kwanga, or cooked rice were
served in another, vegetables in another. The
people ate with their fingers. A lump of
kwanga, dumpling, bread, or cooked rice was
taken in the fingers and dipped in the broth.
The dumpling was swallowed whole; it could
not be chewed, as it would stick to the teeth
like so much glue, but it would slip down whole
like an oyster. Groups of friends or relatives
ate together, and good breeding was shown in
the special care which every well-brought-up
guest would take, to eat no more than his proper
share. Greediness is very unpopular among
the Bantu, and any unfair division of food is
regarded as the worst possible manners.</p>

<p>During the days that the feast lasted, appetites
were saved up for the evening meal, and
nobody ate anything during the day except
perhaps a little fruit, a handful of peanuts, or
some sugar-cane juice. The Alo Man told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
tales, there was much dancing and singing,
naps were taken at any time of day by those
who were sleepy, and the children played many
games. The children often made almost as
much noise as the grown people, for the boys
had a band of their own. Nkula, who had a
biti—a kind of marimba—which he had
made for himself, was leader.</p>

<p>A game that was a general favorite was played
with the biti and the other instruments, and a
needle. In playing it, the boys divided into
two camps, Mpoko being captain of one, and
Satu, a boy from a neighboring village, of the
other. Boko, one of Mpoko’s players, was
sent out of sight and hearing, and Mpoko then
took a needle—a rather large bone needle
used for raffia or sinew—and hid it so that
both camps would know where it was. Meanwhile
Satu’s camp had agreed upon a certain
note in the scale played on the biti, which should
be the “guiding note.” Then Boko was called
back to hunt for the needle. When he came
near the needle, the player of the biti, Nkula,
who was in Satu’s camp, must sound the guiding
note, mixing it up with as many variations and
other notes as he could, and when Boko moved
away from the needle, the guiding note must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
not be sounded. Of course, if Nkula did not
keep to this rule Mpoko’s side would make
trouble for him. To win for his side, Boko must
not only find the needle but must name the
guiding note.</p>

<p>Boko had a quick ear, and he was a shrewd
boy. Within two or three minutes he was
nearly sure where the needle was, but he was
not certain about the guiding note. Satu’s
side made such a racket that all the notes in the
scale seemed to be part of it. Mpoko felt more
than once like calling out “Otuama” (you are
warm) when Boko stopped two or three times
almost on top of the needle, but of course that
would never do. Then Boko walked across
the ground and came back, went straight to
the hiding place, picked up the needle, and
sounded the correct guiding note!</p>

<p>After they had kept quiet, watching the search
for the needle, as long as active boys could, they
played the game called “antelope.” Boko,
having won in the last game, was antelope. A
line was scratched on the ground, marking out
a large court, and all the boys except Boko got
down on all fours with their faces uplifted. They
were the hunters, and they tried to touch Boko
with their hands, or kick him with their feet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
or butt him with their heads, or pen him up
between them and the boundary line. Since
they had to chase him on all fours, Boko had
an advantage, and once he jumped right over
a hunter who almost had him. When they
finally did get him hemmed in and he ran out of
the ring, they all got on their feet and chased
him, and Nkula, the first to touch him, was
antelope in his turn.</p>

<p>Some of the smaller children were playing a
game of their own, under a bush where the
fowls had been having a dust bath. The large,
black, glossy <i>loso</i> (canna seeds) were used in
this game. While one player went out, the
others hid a canna seed in one of five little
heaps of dirt. The searcher had to sweep away
the four heaps that did not hold any seed, and
leave untouched the heap that did. If he
guessed correctly, it counted one game for his
side.</p>

<p>When they were tired of “antelope,” the older
boys played a rather difficult memory game,
called “loso,” with forty canna seeds. Satu and
Mpoko chose sides, and all sat on the ground
around an open space. Satu, taking twenty
seeds in each hand, led the play. His side had
agreed beforehand that the seventh seed thrown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
should be the “playing seed,” and the other
side would have to guess which it was, and pick
it up. Satu threw first a seed from the right
hand, then one from the left, counting aloud
as he threw until he had thrown ten all together—solo,
beri, tatu, inno, tano, tandatu, pungati,
inani, kenda, ikundi. Then he threw down
the other seeds helter skelter, without counting,
but so as not to disturb the first ten where they
lay.</p>

<p>Then Satu chose Boko to go away out of sight
and hearing of the game, and Mpoko and his
players consulted as to which the “playing seed”
was. In throwing the seeds, Satu had tried not
to call attention to pungati, the seventh seed,
in any way, and had told his players not to seem
to be watching it when he threw it. They did
not. They were so very, very careless just at
that moment that Mpoko wondered if that
were not the “playing seed.” He took note
where it fell and saw that it lay near a little
hump in the ground. When he told his players
what he thought, they said that he was likely to
be right, and when he picked up the seventh
seed and said, “This is the playing seed and its
name is pungati,” Satu admitted that it was
and that Mpoko had won.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
Of course, if Satu and his side were dishonest
players they might deny that the seed picked
up was the playing seed. But that would do
them no good, for Boko, who had been sent
out of sight and hearing, was a check on them.
How the check worked was shown when Mpoko
in his turn threw the seed. This time the
third seed, tatu, was the “playing seed.” It
was the turn of Satu’s side to guess, and they
disagreed. Satu thought it was the fifth, and
the others were divided between the third and
the sixth. In the end they took a chance, and
Satu, picking up the fifth seed, said, “This is
the playing seed, and its name is tano.” But
it wasn’t the playing seed.</p>

<p>Still, Satu’s side had one more chance.
Mpoko had sent Nkula out of sight and hearing
before the discussion began, and Nkula would
have to come back and pick up the playing seed,
depending on his memory of the way in which
the seeds lay when he left the circle. Mpoko
touched tatu, the playing seed, and then called
Nkula back. Everybody watched, breathless.
If Nkula touched the wrong seed, Satu’s side
would still win. But he didn’t. Nkula had a
good memory, and he remembered that tatu,
the playing seed, lay at one end of a line of three,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
the only three seeds close together in a straight
line. He picked it up and said, “This is the
playing seed, and its name is tatu.”</p>

<p>It will be seen that it is almost impossible to
cheat in this game. If Satu had really picked
up the right seed, and Mpoko had denied that
he did, then when Nkula came back there would
have been no right seed on the ground; and if
Mpoko pointed to the wrong seed, the chances
were all against Nkula’s guessing that one seed,
out of the thirty-nine still remaining on the
ground.</p>

<p>The old hunters who were looking on very
much approved of this game, which they had
played when they were boys, and their fathers
and grandfathers before them. A good player
must have a quick eye and a good memory,
both of which are most needful in hunting.
As the Bantu proverb has it, “For a running
antelope one needs a running shot.”</p>

<p>The next game, Mbele, or the Knife, trained
not only the eye but the limbs, and was sometimes
played by boys and girls alike. All the
players stood in line, Satu at the head and
Mpoko next him. Satu stepped out and faced
Mpoko, and holding up both hands waved them
about, and then shot out one hand quickly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
Mpoko countered with the corresponding hand.
This was done three times, and the third time
Mpoko missed, for he was in too much of a
hurry and answered the wrong gesture. Nkula,
who came next, failed also; but in Boko, Satu
met his match, and Boko became “King” in
his turn, while Satu went to the foot of the
line. If the King could go down the line
without meeting his match, the last one in the
line would be called a slave, and would go out.
Sometimes—so Mpoko’s father told them—Satu’s
father, as King, had gone up and down
the line until all the other players were slaves.</p>

<p>Games such as these not only teach the
players to move promptly, see correctly and
remember what they see, but give them practice
in judging by the expression of a person’s face
what he is about to do or what he is thinking.
When a boy trained in games of the wits, like
these, grows up and becomes a chief or a trader,
it is very hard for any one to deceive him, or to
read his face when he does not wish his thoughts
to be known. They are also games which must
be played fairly if there is to be any fun in them.</p>

<p>Besides playing their games, the boys wrestled,
ran races, had contests in high jumping, and
did as much bragging and arguing as is usual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
in a crowd of boys on a three days’ holiday.
On the third day the boys from Satu’s village
and Mpoko and his friends got into an argument,
and there was a quarrel which attracted the
attention of the fathers and led to punishment.</p>

<p>That evening Mpoko remembered something.
He sidled over to the Alo Man, who was just
then sitting by himself mending a marimba,
and said, “What is the story about the People
with the Bandaged Faces?”</p>

<p>“Ho!” said the Alo Man. “Do you think
that fashion is a good one?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Mpoko. “I should
like to see some people with their faces
bandaged.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they might like to see you with
yours bandaged, too,” said the Alo Man.
“However, this is the story.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Once the Rabbit went on a long journey, and
lost his way. When he had wandered a long
time he came to a town where there was a market
place, but the market place was very still.
There were many people, wearing bandages of
white cloth over their faces, who were coming
and going and exchanging their produce for
brass rods, mirrors, trader’s cloth, and ivory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
trumpets. But none of them said a single
word.</p>

<p>“Ho!” said the Rabbit, “this is a very queer
place. Curious kind of people these must be.”</p>

<p>He spoke to one and another, asking for food
and oil and offering to pay, but although they
gave him all that he needed and took his beads
in payment, not one of them said a word in
reply.</p>

<p>It was so queer in that place that the Rabbit
began to be frightened, and at last he left the
market place and went on, looking back over his
shoulder until he was out of sight. When he
came to a house he found an old man, and he
asked the old man what was the matter with the
people of that market, who went and came and
bought and sold, and never said a word.</p>

<p>“That is their custom,” said the old man.
“A long time ago they got into the habit of
quarreling and arguing with one another until
nobody had any peace from morning till night.
Each market day it was worse than the last.
Finally the King heard of it and was angry with
them for their foolishness, and he made a law
that in that village, when the people went to
market, each must leave his lower jaw at
home.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Ten">X</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="ls">HOW THE CARAVAN SET FORTH</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">W<span class="smcap">hen</span> the great feast was over and the
guests had gone home, it was time to
begin in earnest preparations for the caravan.
This had been discussed by the headmen in the
intervals of feasting and entertainment, and it
had been agreed that one of the best-known
wizards of that country should come and make
luck charms and see that everything was
properly done when the company took its departure.
As this village was farther down the
river than the others, it was to be the place of
meeting.</p>

<p>Among other matters, the men from different
villages had discussed what goods were most
likely to be profitable in trading. They all
agreed that the traders were not like the Bantu
people, who prefer to do the same things and
follow the same customs year in and year out;
the traders were forever changing their minds.
Things which used to be much in demand were
now not wanted. The older men, for example,
could remember how, when they were boys,
camwood and barwood and African mahogany<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
were asked for. It was said that in some parts
of the forest it paid even now to take ebony and
teak and other kinds of lumber to the coast.
But this was only where the logs could go down
by water. There were too many rapids and
the distance was too great to make any such
trade profitable for this village.</p>

<p>Camwood is very good for cabinet work; it
is light brown when cut, and with exposure to
the air turns a beautiful deep red-brown. Barwood
is sometimes used for violin bows. Both
these trees are cousins of the California redwoods,
though they do not grow to be giants. But in
the days when the traders bought the wood, it
was not for cabinet work; it was for dyestuffs.
Before aniline dye was invented, the rich dull
red of Madras handkerchiefs was made by
boiling the chips of these woods in water. Such
a dye would not fade like the colors in the cloth
now sold by the traders.</p>

<p>The most profitable thing found in the great
forest storehouse was rubber. Mpoko himself
had helped get some of the supply of it that
was waiting to go down to the coast. This
work of getting rubber is done usually in August,
or from October to March during the dry season,
when there is not so much to do on the farms and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
it is pleasanter to work in the woods. The
women prepare about three weeks’ food for the
rubber gatherers, who camp in the woods while
the work goes on.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_126.jpg"
 alt="tapping a tree">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The latex, or sap, is collected in various
ways. A cut may be made in the tree and a
broken bottle, a large snail shell, or a gourd
fastened below to receive the sap. Rubber is
also obtained from lianas or vines which are
sometimes cut up to let the sap drain into basins
from both ends of the stem at once. Toward
evening or in the early morning the sap is collected
and put into iron pots. It is a rather
thick, milky juice, and the rubber is separated
from the watery fluid either by boiling or by
adding lime juice or tannin squeezed from wild
fruits. Then it is dried, in the form of strips,
or strips rolled into a ball, or flat cakes, over the
smoke of a wood fire. Sometimes it is soaked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
in streams to clear out the impurities, a practice
which adds to its weight but is not honest. One
man can collect three or four pounds a day, for
which the trader will pay a shilling a pound.</p>

<p>Another thing that was going into the packs
of the porters now was raffia. In the old days
this was never valuable. Now there seemed to
be a market for it. It was first exported in
1890, the price then being from $300 to $350 a
ton. Later it was about $100. Long before
it was known to our schools for basket making
and mat making, the Bantu people used the
long, tough strips for netting, weaving, and
many other purposes.</p>

<p>When the men went into the forest to add
raffia and some other things to their stock for the
trading journey, Mpoko and Nkula went with
them. The forest was a wonderful place even
to them, who had never known any other
country, and to a civilized boy it would have
looked like fairyland. Monkeys leaped and
chattered in the branches, and birds of many
sorts, many of them splendid in coloring, hopped
and flew among the trees. There were wild
canaries, waxbills, crows, now and then a red-tailed
gray parrot, and the bright-colored
plantain-eater, or touraco, as the boys called it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
This bird, a distant cousin of the cuckoo, has a
crest like a jay’s, which it can raise or lower,
and its call sounds almost exactly like “touraco,
tu-ra-co!” The queerest-looking bird of all,
perhaps, was the ground hornbill, which is as
common about African villages as a crow.
This bird looks as if it had been trying to imitate
the rhinoceros, for it has a great horny bill with
a thick lump on what might be called the bridge
of the nose. It is useful to the villager, for it
is a sort of street cleaner in feathers, and eats
garbage, rats, snakes, lizards, and other small
creatures, with great relish.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_128.jpg"
 alt="ground hornbill">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Mpoko and Nkula caught a bunting to take
home and tame, and they came upon a little
group of the dome-shaped huts of the weaver
bird. On the way home the party went out of
its way to the Red Rocks. This was the name
the boys had for them, but the place was really
an outcrop of iron ore, red with rust from the
air and the dampness. While the men were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
getting out some lumps of ore to be made into
weapons, the boys went exploring and found
something surprising on their own account.</p>

<p>In a little clearing farther up the mountain,
great yellow globes were shining on the ground
among coarse vines. They were pumpkins.
But how came pumpkins away up there, miles
away from any farm or house? It really
looked like witchery. But when the hunters
saw them they laughed and said that the boys
had happened on the Elephant’s Garden. These
had sprung up from seeds of the pumpkins carried
off by elephants from some settlement.</p>

<p>If the loads had not already been heavy
enough, more of the pumpkins would have been
carried away, and as it was, the two which
Mpoko and Nkula carried were quite heavy
enough before they had a chance to drop them.
Iron was more important just then.</p>

<p>Nkula’s father was the smith and ever since
they could remember, Nkula and Mpoko had
watched the business of making iron tools and
weapons. Very few boys outside the jungle
know as much as these two did about the way
in which iron is made into useful articles.</p>

<p>The iron as it is found in that country is not
so mixed with other minerals as to be hard to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
separate. Sometimes a lump would be found
almost pure. But in order to make it suitable
for the blacksmith’s hammer, it had to be
smelted. A furnace was made of clay, and a
hole was dug in the ground, big enough to sink
it in. Around this hole a clay wall was built
up into a sort of chimney, and a tunnel was
dug from a little distance away, down to the
charcoal fire at the bottom of the furnace. The
fire, which must be kept up to the very greatest
possible heat, was fed with fresh air through
this tunnel by means of a goatskin bellows with
a stone nozzle. After two or three hours of
uninterrupted heat, there would be a lump of
pig iron, and the impurities could be hammered
out and the metal worked into shape on a forge.</p>

<p>Nkula’s father knew how to make spear
heads, ax heads, knives with leaf-shaped or
curved blades, and iron wire, which, when
passed red-hot over buffalo horn, blackened and
became nearly rust-proof. Iron wire could also
be polished and used for ornaments, although the
people preferred brass wire, which would not
rust. Among the things which Nkunda’s mother
treasured was a necklace of grayish-brown
mottled nuts like pairs of little pyramids set
base to base, fastened together, not by a string,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
but by little links of iron wire. A cross formed
of the nuts made a kind of pendant, and although
nobody in the village knew it, the necklace had
probably been made in some coast village, for a
rosary, from the nuts of a eucalyptus or “fever
tree” near a mission settlement.</p>

<p>While the preparations for the expedition
were going on, even the monkeys appeared to
know that it was a busy time, and they leaped
and chattered and swung from tree to tree as if
they too had important affairs on hand. As the
Alo Man watched them, he was reminded of the
story of the Scrawny Old Man and the Scrawny
Old Woman.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_131.jpg"
 alt="making a spear head">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
I often tell [said he] of the scrawny old man
and the scrawny old woman who lived in a hut
in the forest. They always complained of being
very poor and having hardly enough to eat,
but by and by the neighbors noticed that after
the two had visited at any house, something
or other was always missed. Then one day a
neighbor who was sick in bed awoke to see them
going out of his hut with his bag of cowrie shells
between them. He shouted and shouted at
them, but they did not stop, and after a while
some of the other neighbors heard and came
running in to see who was being murdered.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, oh!” wailed the poor sick man.
“The scrawny old man and the scrawny old
woman have been here, and they have taken
all my cowries and gone away!”</p>

<p>The neighbors looked at one another and
nodded. They told the sick man not to wail
and weep any more, for they would attend to
getting back his bag of cowries.</p>

<p>Then they went all together to the house of
the scrawny old man and the scrawny old woman
and said, “Give us back the bag of cowries that
you stole from the poor sick man, or we will
beat you with whips of hippopotamus hide!”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
 <img src="images/i_133.jpg"
 alt="hut in forest">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>But the scrawny old man and the scrawny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
old woman cried and howled and said that they
had not taken the bag of cowries. And when
the neighbors searched the hut they did not
find it.</p>

<p>But the neighbors still believed that the
scrawny old man and the scrawny old woman
had taken the bag of cowries, and they said,
“We will come with our whips of hippopotamus
hide and you shall eat whip until you give
back the cowries that you stole.”</p>

<p>Then while the neighbors went to fetch their
whips, the scrawny old man and the scrawny
old woman climbed up and got the bag of
cowries, which they had hidden in the thatch of
the roof, and ran with it into the forest. But
they were not quite quick enough. The neighbors
saw them and came after them so fast with
their whips of hippopotamus hide, that at last
the scrawny old man and the scrawny old
woman had to climb into a tree.</p>

<p>“You shall not come down from the tree,”
cried the neighbors, looking up at the scrawny
old man and the scrawny old woman where they
squatted among the branches, “until you give
back the cowries that you stole from the poor
sick man.”</p>

<p>“We will stay in this tree until they go away,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
and then we will climb down and escape,” said
the scrawny old man to the scrawny old woman.</p>

<p>The neighbors heard what he said, and they
shouted, “We will stay under the tree until you
come down.”</p>

<p>“When they go home to get their supper we
will climb down and run away very fast in the
dark,” said the scrawny old woman to the
scrawny old man.</p>

<p>The neighbors heard her, and they shouted,
“We will build huts under the tree and take
turns watching for you to come down.”</p>

<p>And so they did.</p>

<p>Days passed, then weeks, then months. The
scrawny old man and the scrawny old woman
sat in the tree waiting for the neighbors to go
away, and the neighbors sat under the tree
waiting for them to come down. The scrawny
old man and the scrawny old woman became
very hungry. First they ate the fruit of the
tree; then they ate the kernels; then they ate
the young leaves; then they ate the old leaves;
at last they stripped the bark off the branches
and ate that. They grew scrawnier and
scrawnier every day. Their eyes had sunk in
their heads with sleeplessness. Their teeth
grew long and sharp with cracking the kernels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
of the fruit and gnawing the bark from the tree.
They almost forgot how to talk.</p>

<p>One day the scrawny old man held out his
scrawny old hand and said, “See how tough the
skin is!” And the scrawny old woman held
out her scrawny old hand and said, “My hand
is just as tough as yours!”</p>

<p>Then they looked at their feet and saw that
the skin of their feet had grown tough also;
and their toe nails and finger nails had grown
long, like claws, with holding on so firmly to
the branches of the tree.</p>

<p>“It is very strange,” said the scrawny old
man.</p>

<p>“Indeed, it is very strange,” said the scrawny
old woman.</p>

<p>Then the new year came with its heavy rains,
and the scrawny old man and scrawny old
woman shivered with cold. One morning the
scrawny old man said to the scrawny old woman,
“This is very strange. You are all covered with
hair.”</p>

<p>And the scrawny old woman said to the
scrawny old man, “It is surely very strange,
but so are you.”</p>

<p>It really seemed as if they were not the same
persons that they were when they climbed into
the tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
Then one morning the scrawny old man said
to the scrawny old woman, “I have a very
strange feeling at the end of my spine.”</p>

<p>“So have I!” said the scrawny old woman.
“What can be going to happen now?”</p>

<p>And behold, each had a tail just beginning
to grow!</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_137.jpg"
 alt="monkeys on tree branch">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The Jackal says it was then that the scrawny
old man and the scrawny old woman began to
chatter and shriek at each other as if they had
lost their wits, but no one can tell whether or
not they were blaming each other for the strange
things that had happened to them, because from
that day to this no one has been able to understand
what they say. Certain it is that when
they found their appearance was so completely
changed, they began to leap from one branch
to another and from one tree to another, and
so escaped from the neighbors, who were still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
at the foot of the tree, waiting for them to come
down. But they let go the bag of cowries in
their flight, and it fell to the ground and was
picked up by the neighbors, who carried it back
to the poor sick man.</p>

<p>And from that day to this the People of the
Trees have all been little scrawny old men and
old women who chase one another from tree to
tree, and chatter and shriek and quarrel, and
sometimes come down and steal things from the
huts, but very seldom are able to keep what they
have stolen. And from that day to this they
have not forgotten that they once were people
and lived in a village, for they build little huts
in the branches for their young ones, and are
always watching what the people of the village
do and trying to be like them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It is not known whether the monkey story
had anything to do with it or not, but during
the final preparations for the trading expedition
there was no quarreling and things went
on in a very orderly and businesslike fashion.</p>

<p>When the carriers had all come in from the
other villages, there were more than a hundred
all together, and last of all the medicine man
made his appearance. He was a little, wizened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
shrewd-looking old fellow who carried a charm
bag and a wooden fetich image which nobody
would have touched for anything. It must
have been at least three or four hundred years
old, for it was a stumpy carved statue of a
Portuguese sea captain in the dress of the sixteenth
century, and the wood had turned almost
black with age. Nobody in Africa could possibly
have seen anything like it for many generations,
and naturally it was thought to be magic.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_139.jpg"
 alt="medicine man">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The medicine man called all the headmen
together and sat them down in a circle, he and
his fetich occupying the middle. On his head
was a crown of gay feathers, and his costume
was made up chiefly of rattles, beads, and ornaments
of magical power. He made a little
speech to the fetich, asking it to give good luck
to the caravan, to keep it safe from danger of
water, flame, or iron, and to make it successful
in its dealings. Then he sacrificed a chicken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
to the fetich, and the chicken was solemnly
cooked and eaten by the company. No one
in the caravan could after that enter his house
or turn back upon the road. The medicine
man selected charms from those in his charm
bag—herbs, spices, feathers, and little bones—and
put them in a shell which he set in the
middle of the trail. Then the caravan was
ready to start. The long procession of traders,
porters, headmen, and soldiers moved in a swinging
stride down the path, each one stepping
over the shell and not looking back. No one
touched the shell, which was very lucky, and
whether the medicine man’s ceremonies had
anything to do with it or not, the expedition
returned safely in due time, with a tale of good
luck on the trail and success in the trading.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Eleven">XI</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="ls">THE HYRAX AND THE ELEPHANT</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> returning caravan brought new people
to the village. It had met an Arab trader
coming up the river with his porters and some
armed men for a bodyguard. The Arab could
speak a little Bantu, and the language he talked
to his men was a dialect called Swahili, which is
something like Bantu and is spoken by most of
the traders. When he saw the villagers’ rubber
and palm oil and heard about their country, he
seemed much interested, and wished to try their
markets. He seemed very glad of their company
on the journey.</p>

<p>When he showed his wares, there was great
excitement in the village. He had brass rods,
of course, and glass bottles of perfumery that
smelled stronger than a whole tree in blossom.
The bottles themselves would do to make into
bangles; some of the Bantu tribes understood
how to melt glass and make it into ornaments.
He had little bright mirrors, gay cloth, and
knives that were more shiny and attractive
than any the people had seen, though Nkula’s
father said that they were not very sharp. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
trader wore clothes all over him, and a white
cloth on his head; in the sash round his waist
were stuck strange weapons, and he did not eat
as they did in the village. He had his own cook.</p>

<p>The Alo Man did not say much about the
trader, and he was polite enough to him; but
Mpoko felt sure that he did not like the stranger.
It is possible to say many things without words.</p>

<p>As time went on, pleasant as it was to see all
these new things and share in the presents the
trader gave, Nkunda and some of the other
children began to wish he would go away soon.
Everybody was so cross in these days that there
was no comfort in living. Even the mother of
Mpoko and Nkunda, who was usually very
gentle and kind, had said sharp words now and
then. In some of the other families the mothers
whipped the children all round with no excuse
whatever.</p>

<p>When the trader and his men had gone to
the Nkenge market, two days’ journey away,
every one was glad to hear the drum sound after
supper for a dance and some story-telling.
Mpoko climbed up in the big tree under which
the chief held his councils and gave his judgments,
to get a better view of the dancing.
When that was over and the story began, he let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
himself down to a lower branch, and lay along
it like a little tree animal. He was almost as
much at home in the trees as on the ground.
Sometimes he would go up to the very tiptop
of some giant of the forest and perch among the
cool green leaves, looking out over the great
green sea of tree tops and tree ferns beneath
him, and thinking.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_143.jpg"
 alt="group of hunters">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Tonight the story was about the Elephant
and the Hyrax. One of the hunters that day
had brought home a hyrax from the rocky
hillside where he had been hunting, and that
may have been what reminded the Alo Man of
the story. The hyrax is a little beast about as
big as a rabbit and something like one, but with
ears like a guinea pig; and although neither the
story-teller nor his listeners knew it, he is a very
distant cousin of the rhinoceros, the elephant,
and the other thick-skinned animals. But he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
has no tusks or horns, and he wears a coat of
grayish-brown fur, and hides in holes among the
rocks.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the days when all the animals lived in
villages and owned plantations [began the
Alo Man], there were a Hyrax and his wife
who had a little son. Father Hyrax was so
proud of his baby that he told Mother Hyrax
to ask for anything she liked and she should
have it.</p>

<p>“I should like the skin of an Elephant,”
said she, for she thought that her husband could
do anything.</p>

<p>The Hyrax did not know what to say to this
astonishing request, but he knew that if he did
not keep his word to his wife she would have no
respect for him. At last he went to a very
old Hyrax whose fur was entirely white and who
lived in a den by himself far up on the mountain,
and asked his advice.</p>

<p>“It is almost harvest time,” said the very old
Hyrax when he had heard the story. “Go and
ask the Earthworm, the Cock, the Cat, the Dog,
the Hyena, the Leopard, and the Elephant to
come and help you with your harvest. When
they come, you will see what to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
“I do not understand,” said the Hyrax.</p>

<p>“No matter,” said the very old Hyrax. “Do
as I tell you, and all will be well.”</p>

<p>The Hyrax did exactly as he had been told,
and asked all the creatures to come and help
him with his harvest. All promised to come.
Then he went home and waited.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the Earthworm came
with his spear and his hoe and went to work.
Next the Cock appeared with his spear and his
hoe.</p>

<p>“Is any one here?” asked the Cock.</p>

<p>“The Earthworm has come. He is at work
over there,” said the Hyrax.</p>

<p>“He will make a fine breakfast for me,” said
the Cock, and he gobbled the Earthworm and
went to work.</p>

<p>Then the Cat came with his spear and his
hoe.</p>

<p>“Is any one here?” asked the Cat.</p>

<p>“The Cock is here. He is at work yonder,”
said the Hyrax.</p>

<p>“He will make a good meal for me,” said the
Cat, and he pounced on the Cock and ate him
up, and then went to work.</p>

<p>Then the Dog appeared with his spear and his
hoe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
“Is any one here?” asked the Dog.</p>

<p>“The Cat is here. He is already at work,”
said the Hyrax.</p>

<p>“He will make a good dinner for me,” said the
Dog, and he grabbed the Cat and ate him up,
and went to work.</p>

<p>The Hyena came next, and he ate the Dog.
The Leopard came next, and he ate the Hyena.
Last of all came the Elephant with his spear and
his hoe.</p>

<p>“Is any one here?” asked the Elephant.</p>

<p>“The Leopard is here and is at work yonder,”
said the Hyrax.</p>

<p>“Did any one come before the Leopard?”
inquired the Elephant.</p>

<p>“The Hyena.”</p>

<p>“And before the Hyena?”</p>

<p>“The Dog.”</p>

<p>“And before the Dog?”</p>

<p>“The Cat.”</p>

<p>“And before the Cat?”</p>

<p>“The Cock.”</p>

<p>“And before the Cock?”</p>

<p>“The Earthworm.”</p>

<p>The Elephant looked about and did not see
any of these other animals.</p>

<p>“What became of the Earthworm?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
“The Cock ate him.”</p>

<p>“And what became of the Cock?”</p>

<p>“The Cat ate him.”</p>

<p>“And what became of the Cat?”</p>

<p>“The Dog ate him.”</p>

<p>“And what became of the Dog?”</p>

<p>“The Hyena ate him.”</p>

<p>“And what became of the Hyena?”</p>

<p>“The Leopard ate him.”</p>

<p>The Elephant looked at the Leopard at work
in the field.</p>

<p>“Then,” he said, “I must eat the Leopard or
I shall not be respected by all the other animals.
But if I am to do this I must come up behind
him and strike him with my trunk.”</p>

<p>The Hyrax remembered something.</p>

<p>“Come with me,” he said, “and I will show
you a way to go round behind the Leopard
without his seeing you.”</p>

<p>Then he led the Elephant along a path in
the middle of which was a deep hole among the
rocks, and in the bottom of the hole was a sharp
stake, and over the hole was a great mass of
underbrush and vines and grass, all matted
together. The Elephant stepped on it and fell
down into the pit on the sharp stake and was
killed. Then the Hyrax climbed down into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
pit and skinned him, and brought the skin home
to his wife.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>All the people laughed and clapped their
hands and said that the story was a good story,
and some of them began to sing and dance again.
Mpoko climbed a little farther up among the
boughs, crooked his arms and legs around them
so that he could sit comfortably, and thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
about the story. It was not so wonderful that
the Hyrax had killed the Elephant. Not long
before the hunters of the village had done
almost the same thing. It struck Mpoko that
in almost all the stories the little animal got the
best of the bigger ones by wise planning. While
he was thinking it over, he went to sleep.
When he awoke, later in the evening, most of
the people had gone into their huts, and his
father with some of the older men sat under the
tree talking.</p>

<p>“I am not much like the Hyrax, for I am in a
trap myself,” thought Mpoko, in disgust. “If I
get down, they will think I have been listening
and they will certainly make me eat whip. If
I keep still until they go away and then get
down, I shall not be beaten unless I tell what I
hear, and I shall be very careful not to do that.
This is a time for the wise man to stay behind
the hedge of thorns,”—which was one of the
Alo Man’s proverbs. It means to keep your
tongue behind your teeth.</p>

<p>The boy lay along the bough, as flat as a
squirrel or a lizard, while the palaver went on.
He did not expect to hear anything interesting.
It would probably be talk about the crops,
or the things to be bought at the next market,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
or some such matter. But it proved to be a
terribly fascinating discussion. Mpoko kept
stiller than ever as he listened. He did not
know what would happen to him if he should
be found there.</p>

<p>The chief and his old men were worried over
the trader’s doings. In some of his glass bottles
he had strong drink which took away a man’s
sense and made him quarrelsome and silly.
“Drink beer, think beer,” the Bantu proverb
says; but this was something much worse than
any of the mild drinks made by the natives.
Even a little of it would lead a man to make
the most foolish bargains and tell whatever he
knew. The trader was spoiling the country,
they said.</p>

<p>Then the Alo Man spoke, and he had an even
more dreadful thing to tell. He had once seen
this trader coming in from a wild country with
about twenty slaves, forked limbs over their
necks, chained to one another and guarded by
armed men. These men carried weapons which
could kill from a distance with a great noise.
The trader’s bodyguard had them, and might
have more hidden among their wares.</p>

<p>This was the worst possible news. All the
people knew what slave raids were. They had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
lived in fear of Tswki for years and years for
this very reason. His army was so strong that
he had from time to time come over the mountain
and burned a village and carried off men,
women, and children to a far country where
they would never see their own people again.
But for some time now Tswki had let them alone.
The Alo Man had heard that in the country
beyond Tswki’s country there were new rulers
and new laws, punishing all who took or sold
slaves. If this were so, it would keep Tswki
from selling any captives he might take, and
would make him afraid to raid the villages of
his neighbors.</p>

<p>But the village could not send a messenger
across Tswki’s country to these new rulers to
get help, even if there were time. The trader
might have many more men coming to help
him. His boat, or dhow, was probably hidden
somewhere down the river, and when he had got
his slaves he would put them on board and go
away. Even if they warned the other villages
and all the fighting men joined to drive him off,
he could kill them much faster than they could
kill his men, with his strange weapons. And
finally, if any such fight happened, Tswki would
hear of it and might come over the mountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
to help the trader and get their country for
himself.</p>

<p>It was a very bad situation, and it looked
worse and worse to them the longer they talked.
The only hopeful fact in sight was that the
trader did not seem to know anything about
Tswki. If he had known, he would probably
have gone to that chief in the beginning, to
buy slaves and to secure his help in getting more.
Yet by this time he might have heard almost
anything from the men who had sold their good
rubber and oil and provisions for his bottles of
trade gin.</p>

<p>Plan after plan was suggested, and there was
something wrong with each one. At last the
men separated and went each to his own hut,
all but the Alo Man, who still sat there in the
deep shadow, thinking. Mpoko slid very cautiously
down on the far side of the tree, but just
as he reached the ground the Alo Man spoke
his name in a low tone. Then Mpoko knew
that the Alo Man had seen him, but that no
one else had.</p>

<p>“I went to sleep in the tree,” he said
sheepishly.</p>

<p>“You had better forget what you heard,”
said the Alo Man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
Mpoko lingered, digging one bare brown toe
into the earth.</p>

<p>“Uncle,” he said, “we are like the Hyrax
who had to trap the Elephant.” After a pause
he added, “The Hyrax did it.”</p>

<p>The Alo Man gave Mpoko a quick glance,
pleased and surprised and interested. “What
is inside your mind, Mpoko?” he asked.</p>

<p>“This,” said Mpoko. “There is a deep
elephant pit on the trail over the mountain to
Tswki’s country. The hunters found it when
they were chasing the hyrax today. Tswki
has much ivory, and the trader loves ivory.
He asks about it all the time.”</p>

<p>The Alo Man’s mind began to link itself with
Mpoko’s as one monkey swinging through the
tree tops catches the paw of another. “Go on,
my son,” he said.</p>

<p>“We are a little people,” said Mpoko. “We
cannot fight the trader. But Tswki could,
and he would do it if he were angry. If the
trader came to take his ivory, Tswki would be
very angry. The trader has many men to
serve him. But if they were in the elephant
pit, they could not serve him.”</p>

<p>“Eh-eh-eh-eh!” chuckled the Alo Man, as a
plan dawned upon him. “You are as wise as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
the very old Hyrax himself. Go now to sleep,
or your head in the morning will be as white as
his.”</p>

<p>Mpoko was not sure whether the Alo Man
really thought his ideas worth anything, or
not. But on the next day there was another
and a better palaver, and a plan was worked out
by the chief and the Alo Man and the wisest of
the old men, in which Mpoko, as was only right,
had a chance to do his part.</p>

<p>Word went out to all the friendly villages to
watch the river for any sign of strange boats or
men. When the Arab trader came back from
the market, the river villages knew exactly
what they were going to do.</p>

<p>The Arab had planned to take each village
by itself, beginning with this one, attack the
people suddenly by night, kill all who were
not able to travel, and send the others down
with a guard to the place where his boat was
waiting. Before the news of the raids had gone
out so that the people of the country could resist
him, he would be away.</p>

<p>But now he began to hear stories of a chief
on the other side of the mountain who had
much ivory. Slaves, in the trade slang, were
called “black ivory,” but this ivory was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
real kind—solid elephant tusks. It struck
the trader that if he could get this ivory and
make his new slaves carry it, this would turn
out to be a very profitable trip indeed.</p>

<p>The question was, how to get the ivory. From
all accounts Tswki was a strong, fierce chief,
and it might be dangerous to go into his country
with as small a force as the trader had. The
Arab had not enough goods to pay for very
much ivory, and he did not wish to pay for it if
he could get it without paying. He might
catch his slaves and go down to the coast, and
come back with a larger party of armed men;
but after slave raiding here once it would not
be nearly so easy to travel through the country
again. He thought of trying to get the people
of the river villages to join him in raiding
Tswki’s country, but they all seemed so afraid
of that chief that he did not believe they would
do it. He kept asking questions about the
ivory, and by the time he had finished trading
and was ready to go back down the river, he had
heard so much about it that he dreamed of it
every night. He felt that somehow or other
he must have that ivory or he would be sorry to
the end of his days.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Twelve">XII</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="ls">A VOICE IN THE FOREST</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">hings</span> were very unsatisfactory to the
trader on the last night of his stay as a
guest in the village. He had intended it to be
the last night that he or any of the people of
the village should sleep in those huts. But if
he carried out his first plan, and fell upon them
in the dark hours just after midnight, killing,
burning, and plundering, and then taking up his
march to the next village to do the same thing,
he would have to give up all hope of the ivory.
While he was sitting by himself, trying to think
of a way out of the difficulty, Mpoko stole up
to him in the dark and pulled at his sleeve.
“Come quickly,” he murmured, “there is a
palaver going on behind the ruined huts, and it
is about ivory.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_156.jpg"
 alt="Arab and Mpoko">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
The Arab was naturally suspicious, and the
life that he had led had made him more so. He
had been almost sure in the last day or two that
there was something he had not yet found out
about that ivory. He knew a great deal about
native tribes, and he was aware that they are
very good at hiding anything they do not wish
to have known. He remembered that Mpoko
had been limping about the village as if suffering
from a severe beating; indeed, the boy
seemed hardly able to walk now. That was
just what would have happened if he had heard
something his elders were saying and they had
found it out. And what could be more natural
than that he should revenge himself by telling
what he had heard? The trader would have
done that himself in Mpoko’s place.</p>

<p>Mpoko slid along in the shadow and dropped
on all fours, signing to the trader to do likewise.
They wormed along through tall grass and
thorn bushes and thickets for what seemed
hours and hours, in the dark. Mpoko would
have liked to lead the Arab round and round
the village all night. As it was, they followed
a very roundabout cattle track, and the trader’s
clothes, which were not made for crawling,
suffered a great deal from thorns and mire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>At last they reached a pile of ruined thatch
and mud wall, and sure enough, there were men
on the other side of the heap, talking together
in low tones. Mpoko ducked into the shadow
and vanished like a scared rabbit. The trader
crouched motionless, his hand on his dagger,
listening.</p>

<p>“Then everything is ready?” said the chief.</p>

<p>“Everything,” said the smith.</p>

<p>“And the stranger does not suspect?” said
the oldest of the villagers.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Mpoko’s father, “that he has
quite given up any thought of the ivory now.
We have scared him very well.”</p>

<p>“What a joke it will be?” said the smith,
“when we tell people that the stranger was
afraid of Tswki!”</p>

<p>“A feeble old man without sons,” said one of
the hunters, “and all that ivory which the
trader, with his strong men armed with the
weapons that kill far off, does not dare to go
and take!”</p>

<p>“It is all the better,” said the chief, rising.
“When the trader has gone, we will get the ivory
and carry it to the trading station ourselves.”</p>

<p>Then the group of men went away, and the
Arab, gritting his teeth with rage, found his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
way back to his own tent. His mind was quite
made up. He would break camp early in the
morning and go straight over the mountain
into Tswki’s country and get that ivory and,
if possible, a gang of slaves. Then he would
come back and punish the villages, and if there
were any joke to be told it would be on them,
not on him.</p>

<p>He got Mpoko into his hut while his porters
were packing, and questioned him closely. It
was not for nothing that Mpoko had played biti
and other games in which he had learned not to
show his feelings. He said that what the trader
had heard of Tswki was indeed true. He had
not given them any trouble for a long time—many
years. Mpoko had heard that there
was a stockade of elephant’s tusks, all picked
for their great size, round the group of huts
in which Tswki lived with his family. Remembering
what the Alo Man had told of the riches
of the king whom he had visited, Mpoko
described the carved ivory oil dishes and knife
handles, the war trumpets and combs and
bowls, which he said he had heard that Tswki
had. White men would give many, many
brass rods for such things, but until now it had
not been safe to try to get them. Now the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
villages had agreed to forget all private quarrels
and join in raiding Tswki’s country. Yes,
Mpoko knew the road up the mountain. No,
it was not very easy to find. One might get
lost in the forest. He would not like to show
the trader the way, because it might get him
into trouble with his father.</p>

<p>The trader pulled at his black beard impatiently.
It would not do to get lost in the
forest. Neither would it do to arouse suspicion.
Mpoko suggested that the Alo Man also knew
the road up the mountain. The trader asked
if the Alo Man would be the guide. Mpoko
thought he would hardly do that, but he was
going to visit Tswki, and Mpoko might get
leave to go with him for a few miles and then
slip away and join the trader. This seemed a
good idea, and the trader agreed. He was
glad that the Alo Man would be out of the way
when the villages were raided, for he had an
uneasy notion that with a good leader the people
might give him some trouble. If they traveled
fast, they could overtake the Alo Man before
they got to Tswki’s country and could make
sure that he would give them no further trouble.</p>

<p>The Alo Man had already gone when the
trader and his men set forth. In fact, he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
gone the night before, although nobody knew
it but the chief and one or two other people.
Mpoko kept a little ahead of the trader’s party,
swinging from tree to tree like a monkey, or
peering back from behind a thorn bush or grass
clump. Just as the trail began to be hard to
find, he dropped to the ground and stood waiting
for them as they came panting up the path.</p>

<p>Very little was said as the Arab and his men
followed the slim brown figure of the boy through
the jungle. Every man had firearms, and they
had given a little shooting exhibition the day
before that had impressed the people deeply.
The Arab felt sure that when he got ready to
take his prisoners, they would be too scared to
make any fight. He expected to have some
trouble getting the ivory, but he was not a
coward and did not mind fighting when he was
sure that he would win in the end. He counted
very much on the surprise he would give the old
chief when he made the attack. Each one of his
men, with gun and revolver, was equal to many
Africans armed only with spears, and according
to all accounts Tswki depended on the strength
of his town there on the hillside and not on a
strong guard.</p>

<p>Of course the trader did not know that about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
an hour after he left the village, Mpoko’s father,
with every fighting man he could muster, in full
war dress, with feather headdresses, long spears,
round hide-covered shields and horn-handled
knives, had started up that very trail. The
men of the village had come on at such a pace
that they had to check themselves for fear of
catching up with the men they were following.
A scout was sent on now and then to make sure
that the Arab was still going up the mountain.</p>

<p>From time to time other parties of warriors
came in from trails that branched off into the
forest. By the time the belt of forest began to
grow thinner and the trail came out on the rocky
open ground above, there was a very considerable
band of grim, fierce-looking spearmen
crowding up through the trees and crouching
behind bushes.</p>

<p>Mpoko looked back and caught a glimpse of
the flutter of plumes. He pointed up the
mountain to a pile of boulders clear against the
sky on the top of the ridge.</p>

<p>“That is the way to Tswki’s country,” he
said. “I do not dare to go any farther. I
may get beaten as it is.”</p>

<p>“You will get something worse than a beating
if you don’t come,” said the Arab. “Come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
with us and we will give you a share in the
ivory. Go back and you will be killed.”</p>

<p>Mpoko had not counted on this. He looked
at the pile of rocks far above, and at the sunburnt
bare slope strewn with boulders. He
looked at the forest behind. He was sure from
what he had seen of the Arab’s shooting that he
would not live to get back to the shelter of the
trees. He dug one toe into the earth and
whimpered. “Do not shoot,” he said. “I
will go.”</p>

<p>Laden with their guns, the Arab’s men could
not climb as fast as Mpoko could, and he kept
some distance ahead. The trail made a turn
toward the right, about halfway to the top, and
here the elephant pit had been formed by the
washing out of a deep hole in the rainy season.
It was covered over with woven grass and boughs,
and it looked as if the long grass had blown
over the trail just there. Mpoko scampered
across and ducked behind a boulder beyond.
Out from the woods came streaming a company
of tribesmen, shouting and waving their spears.
The Arab looked at the pile of rocks above,
and saw that behind those rocks he and his
men could defy any number of enemies with
spears. The warriors behind them were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
yet within range of the firearms, but they soon
would be. The slave traders began to run. If
they could not get to the top, at least they
could get behind the boulders where the road
made that turn.</p>

<p>Then down they tumbled into a great hole.
The woven screen of foliage held long enough
to let them all get on, and then gave way,
exactly as it would do if an elephant were to
step on it. The trader’s men went down all
in a heap, and a revolver or two went off in the
confusion. They could hear the yells of the
men coming up the hill.</p>

<p>The Arab could not make out at first what
had happened. He knew he had been trapped,
but he could not see how it had been done. The
walls of the hole were of solid rock, much too
high to climb, and overhung the bottom of the
pit.</p>

<p>Of course, no one could get at him and his
men to kill them without taking a chance of
being shot, but they could be left there to starve
or die of thirst. The Arab had left many of his
prisoners to starve or die of exhaustion by the
roadside, and now he knew how they had felt.
It was not at all pleasant.</p>

<p>A cheerful jabbering seemed to be going on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
outside. After some time the Alo Man’s voice
could be heard, speaking alone. “Listen, men!”
it said. “We can do nothing as long as they
have their weapons. Let us give them a chance
to live. If they give up their weapons, we can
talk to them.”</p>

<p>The Arab made up his mind quickly. “Let
down a rope,” he shouted in the clearest Bantu
he knew, “and we will tie our guns to it.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_165.jpg"
 alt="hunters">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>After a little talk, a couple of long leather
thongs were flung over the edge of the pit. The
Arab thought he might be able to keep back some
of the weapons, but he found that whoever was
in command seemed to know exactly how many
there ought to be. Then the edge of the pit
was ringed with fierce, feather-crowned faces
looking down at the captives, and there was
more talk. Finally the slave traders were pulled
out and set in the midst of the crowd, each
guarded by a tall and active spearman, and
feeling very much depressed and frightened.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
They knew that if the villagers chose to be
disagreeable, they could be very disagreeable
indeed.</p>

<p>One of the chiefs, a very tall and commanding
figure in a splendid leopard-skin robe, was
Tswki himself, as the Arab discovered with
horror and dismay. The Alo Man was talking
to this chief and trying to make him agree to
something.</p>

<p>“Hear now this plan,” said the Alo Man,
persuasively. “It is true that these men have
planned to come into your country and make
war, and steal your ivory, and you have seen
for yourself that they came with weapons in
their hands and sent no messenger to tell you
of their coming and ask permission to enter
your village. You know also that they are
taking slaves wherever they can, against the
new law. If you kill them, as they deserve, they
will do no more harm, it is true [the Arab’s
teeth began to chatter]; but they will do you
no good. On the other hand, if you tie them
and march them under guard across your
country to the white men, they will do you great
good. You will then be able to say to the
white men: ‘See, I have kept your words in
my heart. I found these men, who are wicked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
and sell men and women against the law, coming
to catch slaves in my country. If you search
their packs you will find fetters that they intended
to put on the slaves they captured. I did
not kill them, although I could have done so.
I did not let them go free to carry off the people
of some other chief. I have brought them to
you for punishment, because you have said
that this is right. I have done this so that
you may know that I am a good man and speak
the truth.’ Then the white man will believe
that you are a good man, and he will be your
friend. It is very good when one has powerful
friends.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i_167.jpg"
 alt="hunters cresting hill">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>This was probably the first chance that
Tswki had ever had to be thought a good,
honest man. The newness of it may have
interested him. He was surprised that the
village people had not killed the slave traders
themselves without calling on him, but really
it was much more clever to have done this.
They could not have taken their prisoners to
the white men without going through his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
country. Now he would get the credit of it all.
Tswki was not called “The Snake” for nothing.
He saw that the plan was a wise one. The
snake is thought by African tribes to be very
wise.</p>

<p>“Your plan is good,” said Tswki finally, after
thinking it over. “That is what I will do.”</p>

<p>“Listen, you men,” said the Alo Man in
Swahili to the trader’s party. “You came into
our country pretending friendship and planning
wickedness. We know that you tried to come
into this chief’s country and steal his ivory
and his people, because you thought that he
was old and feeble and could not fight you.
[Tswki gave a kind of grunt.] You have
weapons which kill with a noise from a long
way off, and you trust in these to make you
strong, like the elephant raging in the jungle.
But you have fallen into a pit through the plan
of a boy, and your strength has been taken from
you as the Elephant’s skin was taken by the
little Hyrax. You are to be sent to the officers
in the white man’s country, who have made
laws to stop the stealing of men and women and
children, and the spoiling of our country with
the drink in the square-faced bottles. Your
men will wait for you awhile and go away. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
they try to come up the river, we will stop them.
Now we have no more to do with you, for you
belong to Tswki.”</p>

<p>Tswki had been listening attentively to this
speech, for he understood some Swahili. He
had a word to add.</p>

<p>“If the other men come up the river to steal
your people,” he said, “we will take them also
to the officers to be punished.”</p>

<p>This showed how Tswki’s ideas had changed
in the last hour or two. He had never before
said “we” when speaking to a chief of the river
villages.</p>

<p>Well pleased with their day’s work, Tswki
and his men moved off down the other side of
the mountain. Well pleased with themselves,
the Alo Man, the chiefs, and their people moved
off down the slope on this side. They carried
with them the goods of the traders, including
the guns, revolvers, powder, and shot, which
they tumbled into the river.</p>

<p>The Alo Man was happy because, for once,
the people of the different villages had united
against an enemy; even Tswki had shown
signs of friendliness! His white teeth flashed
in a joyous smile as he began making a song of
triumph about the trader and the elephant pit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
Mpoko also was happy. He was thinking
that when he was a chief he would rule wisely
and keep his people safe from all enemies, as
his father and the other chiefs and the Alo Man
had done that day. He was wondering also
about those strange new rulers who had said
that the stealing of men and women and children
must stop, and who did not approve of the drink
that took away a man’s senses and made him
do silly things. Mpoko felt that he had seen
and heard and done a great deal since last night.</p>

<p>The people in the village, waiting to catch
the first sound of the Alo Man’s drum, heard
far away the tap-tap-tapping that sent through
the forest the glad news that all was right. The
women began to prepare all sorts of good things
for the evening meal, and as the sun went down
upon the peaceful village and the shining river
and the great mountain standing up out of the
level country beyond the forest, the Alo Man
and his company came home.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p class="drop-cap">A <span class="smcap">new</span> supplementary reader in nature study for the
intermediate grades. A book containing a vast
amount of information relating to insect life—the life
story of the spider, the fly, the bee, the wasp, and other
insects—told by one who was at once a lover of nature, a
great scientist, and a most entertaining writer. Maeterlinck
calls Fabre the “insects’ Homer,” and declares that
his work is as much a classic as the famous Greek epic,
and deserves to be known and studied as a classic.</p>

<p class="unindent">This is the first time that Fabre’s writings have been
made available for school use, and the book will prove
a delight to school children wherever they are given the
chance to read it. No live boy or girl could fail to be
interested in nature subjects presented by so gifted a
naturalist as Fabre in the form of such absorbing adventures.</p>

<p class="unindent">The many quaint sketches with which the book has been
illustrated by Elias Goldberg complete its charm.</p>

<p class="unindent">A useful index is included.</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Numerous attractive, whimsical drawings which caricature the teeth.</li>

<li>2. Quaint rhymes. Vital information is presented in a most amusing
way.</li>

<li>3. Simple expression. The text is suited to the understanding of
pupils as low as the third grade.</li>

<ul>
<li>1. Showing how easily teeth are lost if they are not given constant
attention.</li>

<li>2. Explaining the consequences of the loss of teeth.</li>

<li>3. Making clear the child’s own responsibility for keeping his
teeth by keeping them clean.</li>
</ul>

<p class="hanging">III. <span class="smcap">It Teaches Children How to Care for Their Teeth,

<ul>
<li>1. Accurate illustrations indicating the correct use of the tooth-brush.</li>

<li>2. Directions so plain that the child cannot fail to understand just
what he should do.</li>

<li>3. Recommending regular visits to the dentist, who is represented
as a friend that can assist the child to avoid tooth troubles.</li>
</ul>

<p class="unindent">If habits of oral hygiene are to be formed at all, they must
be instilled while the child mind is most plastic; but existing
texts that deal with oral hygiene at all are too difficult
for young pupils. Dr. Ferguson’s book is adapted to the
use of children in grades three, four, and five; but it will be
found amusing and profitable to older pupils. It is the
only text of its kind, and it deserves a place in every primary
course of study.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap"><i>INTERAMERICAN GEOGRAPHICAL READERS</i></p>

<p class="p2 center muchlarger">A Central American Journey</p>

<p class="center"><i>By</i> ROGER W. BABSON</p>

<div class="small">
<p class="drop-cap">H<span class="smcap">ere</span> is a geographical reader for grade five or six, dealing with
a perfectly new field, being a children’s book based on the big
adventure of big business in the Central American export field.</p>

<p class="unindent">The family of an American business man accompany him on a tour of
Central America. They have many friends there and see not only
the customs and scenery of the country but the way in which people
live in their homes. Moreover, they see how our foreign trade
should be handled to bring about closer relations with our country and
theirs, and learn many picturesque and more or less amusing facts
about the mistakes which have been made.</p>

<p class="unindent">While the interest of the book lies primarily in the things the children
see and hear and do, rather than in any definite plot, there is plenty of
incident, as they visit a gold mine, cacao, coffee, and banana plantations,
a balsam forest, and Indian villages; they travel in unfrequented
regions and experience two earthquakes.</p>

<p class="unindent">The two Carroll children, boy and girl, have become intimate with a
little Central American girl, daughter of a professor in one of the universities,
and have learned Spanish from her. The practical advantages
of a knowledge of Spanish are brought out in the course of the
story.</p>

<p class="unindent">The tendency of the book is to give American children not only an interest
in this picturesque region, but the right view of its people.</p>

<p class="unindent">A part of the educational value is derived from the fact that without
much direct instruction, the importance of accuracy, correct information,
system, and practical experience, and ability, in foreign trade, is
shown.</p>

<p class="unindent">The illustrations from photographs are of great value. The drawings
add to the attractiveness of the volume.</p>

<p class="unindent">The author is the famous statistician, who has visited this country
often, and who writes as entertainingly and informingly as he does
for the readers of his books and magazine articles.</p>
